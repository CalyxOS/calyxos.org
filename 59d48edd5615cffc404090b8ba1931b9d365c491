      "message": "this change includes a lot of interconnected css improvements:\n\n* design-system import: there is now a task to brutally just clone the upstream css and copy the needed css files into place. eventually, we can make a gem for the css which would be the right way(tm).\n\n* switch to sass: by making the main css entry file a sass file, the whole several dozen css files get compiled into a single file. easy! fast loading!\n\n* body text is now full width, and the full width is slightly reduced. this makes it so that tables and multi-columns line up nicely with body text.\n\n* various css tweaks and overrides from the upstream css: tables have normal size font, less huge padding for intro box.\n\n* better, imho, css for toc, plus a better anchor position fix.\n\n* added side navigation support (may need some future adjustment when we see a real tree in action)\n\n* added /test page for previewing design elements",
