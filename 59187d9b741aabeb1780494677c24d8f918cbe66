(someone flashing some other/extra software that can steal your PIN for example)\n\nIn Pixels, I suppose the risk is lower and it is harder to do with the Titan chip, but in the Motos and Fairphones, with an unlocked bootloader, I could see someone flashing TWRP, making a copy of like /data, then installing some other software on which the main purpose is to steal that person\u0027s lock screen/encryption key and then doing decryption. \n\nOr did I just word this bad?",

However, it\u0027s still encrypted.\n\nSince CalyxOS official builds are signed with private keys, installing some other software may also affect data, that remains to be tested.\n\nYour wording is a bit scary, and also not fully accurate. In theory it\u0027s possible, but we don\u0027t know what one can actually gain.\n\nA possibility is yes what you wrote happens, another is you can\u0027t retain the data with modified software.
