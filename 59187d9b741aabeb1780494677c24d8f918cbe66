(someone flashing some other/extra software that can steal your PIN for example)\n\nIn Pixels, I suppose the risk is lower and it is harder to do with the Titan chip, but in the Motos and Fairphones, with an unlocked bootloader, I could see someone flashing TWRP, making a copy of like /data, then installing some other software on which the main purpose is to steal that person\u0027s lock screen/encryption key and then doing decryption. \n\nOr did I just word this bad?",
