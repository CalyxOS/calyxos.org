      "message": "The main and OT channels were intentionally listed first separately, because we want to direct people to those first.\n\n\nThis looks better, and it can certainly be improved in general, but it\u0027ll be confusing for new users to have 10 channels to choose from.",

      "message": "Originally it was actually just the main CalyxOS channel and the Calyx Institute, which isn\u0027t used much; \n\nIt isn\u0027t that complicated, it\u0027s just a list of channels, though it could be better ordered, for the more useful and used channels / relativeness to CalyxOS\n(Calyx Institute ended up being listed last here as it isn\u0027t as CalyxOS related as much as e.g. SeedVault)\n\nIn my mind, it would be something like:\n1. CalyxOS\n2. CalyxOS Testers\n3. CalyxOS Off-Topic\n4. SeedVault Backup\n5. CalyxOS Development\n6. CalyxOS Documentation\n7. CalyxOS Infrastructure\n8. CalyxOS Feeds\n8. Calyx Institute\n\nNot listing Outreach here, it has never really been used, though we could.\n\nAdded this into the latest patchset.\n\nhttps://lucasmz.gitlab.io/calyxos.org/community/",
