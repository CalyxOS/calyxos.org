Some phone makers or mobile carriers do not allow all or some of their devices to unlock the bootloader. On these devices, you cannot enable \u0027[OEM unlocking](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/bootloader/locking_unlocking#unlocking-bootloader)\u0027 to install custom OSes. Unlocking bootloader is different from carrier unlocking. The latter means you can unlock a carrier-locked phone to use SIM cards provided by other carriers on the device. \n```\n\nChanged \"part of their devices\" to \"some of their devices\" as otherwise it felt like it meant a part of a device otherwise.",
