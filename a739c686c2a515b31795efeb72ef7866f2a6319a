This blocking unfortunately is not designed to support state-specific behavior, preventing us from making exceptions for states where call recording is legal. Because CalyxOS inherits AOSP\u0027s behavior here, if this behavior improves upstream, it will be improved for CalyxOS as well.\n```\n\nWhat do you think of these changes? (I know the US is not the only country with states or provinces, but it comes up a lot.)",
