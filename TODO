implement a level system for pages:

1. important, must localize
2. useful, tutorials, etc.
3. technical, not read by many

check out the redirect plugin, don't leave dangle links

website changes: many css changes, get phone pre-installed
phone payment delayed, edit commit to hide the pre-installed option

new css much better for technical notes, eg https://elijh.gitlab.io/calyxos.org/development/build/
