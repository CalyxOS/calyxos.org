I don\u0027t care what we do now for the short term, but for the long term, how about this:\n\nkeep /features as a top level navigation item, but modify it somewhat to include both the \"headline\" features and the additional features at the bottom that are only currently in /features/list.\n\nalso, modify /features to include more links to /docs/guide, when we have the relevant pages ready.",
