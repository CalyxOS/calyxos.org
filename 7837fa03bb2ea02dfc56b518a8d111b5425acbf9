      "message": "My concern is that we now have three copies of the same information:\n\n/features/\n/features/list/\n/doc/guide/* (in various places)\n\nThese seems too difficult to maintain and too much for users. I don\u0027t care what we do now for the short term, but for the long term, how about this:\n\nkeep /features as a top level navigation item, but modify it somewhat to include both the \"headline\" features and the additional features at the bottom that are only currently in /features/list.\n\nalso, modify /features to include more links to /docs/guide, when we have the relevant pages ready.",

Add to features/list\nStep 2. Add anywhere.\n\nSaid list can still be a markdown file somewhere else, or still kept here somehow and just not linked / useful for reference.",
