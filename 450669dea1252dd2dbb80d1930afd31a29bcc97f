It\u0027s likely you plugged it in while locked, therefore it did not work. You can always allow new devices, if you\u0027d like, by going into **Settings -\u003e Security and privacy -\u003e Restrict USB -\u003e Always allow new USB gadgets**. Be aware, however, that this is a security feature.\n```",
