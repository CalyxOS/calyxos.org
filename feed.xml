</ul>

<h4 id="why-these-devices">Why these devices</h4>

<p>Making CalyxOS accessible on diverse devices is always a priority at Calyx. Within our security standards, we keep trying to support as many devices as possible for as long as we can.</p>

<p>CalyxOS requires mobile devices to unlock and relock the bootloader securely during the flashing process to prevent unauthorized root access that can compromise these devices. Among manufacturers who allow secure bootloader unlock and relock, these four Motorola phones are relatively economical compared to other mobile devices, such as Pixel phones. They also have much wider global availability. You can find these models in countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Regional reach and affordability are both important to us.</p>

<p>Additionally, there was already some custom ROM development for these models, and we contributed to their official LineageOS port. That work helps provide the device and hardware specific code CalyxOS relies on.</p>

<h4 id="pre-install-notes">Pre-install notes</h4>

<h4 id="obtaining-an-unlock-code">Obtaining an unlock code</h4>

<p>Motorola requires you to request for a code to unlock the bootloader of these phones. For brand new devices, sometimes it may take up to 3 days before the phone will let you actually enable OEM unlocking. It can be instant or sooner than 3 days as well in many cases.</p>

<p>Do note that unlocking your Motorola voids it’s warranty.</p>

<p>The CalyxOS <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">device-flasher</code> currently does not handle this process, and thus you’ll have to manually unlock the device after obtaining the code.</p>

<p>In the future, we’ll try to automate as much of it as possible.</p>

  <li>An AOSP security vulnerability allows third-party apps to bypass external storage restrictions and access sensitive folders without permissions.</li>
  <li>Google has received at least two reports of this issue, however, they have not released any public disclosure about status of the issue to this date.</li>
  <li>CalyxOS has released a fix to this issue with CalyxOS 6.6.22 and 6.6.23 in April 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>An Android Open Source Project (AOSP) security vulnerability was discovered that allowed third-party apps to bypass restrictions on the /sdcard/Android/data and /sdcard/Android/obb directories. By including “ignorable” Unicode characters (such as ‘\u200b’, a zero-width space) in the path, unauthorized apps could gain access to other apps’ external storage folders, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.</p>

<h4 id="impact">Impact</h4>
<p>The vulnerability allowed unauthorized discovery of installed apps and access to sensitive application data, which — depending on the apps’ design — could include location information, synchronization logs, and other files not intended for cross-app access. An app could use this vulnerability to explore these folders even without having any storage permissions.</p>

<h4 id="affected-devices">Affected devices</h4>
<p>This issue impacts AOSP-based devices with kernel versions 4.19 or greater, which includes all <a href="https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/device-support/">supported CalyxOS devices</a>.</p>

<h4 id="current-status">Current Status</h4>
<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in CalyxOS <a href="https://calyxos.org/news/2025/04/25/april-feature-update/">6.6.22 and 6.6.23</a>, released in April 2025. This update restores expected external storage restrictions and prevents unauthorized access via this bypass technique.
Earlier this year, the CalyxOS team was alerted to this issue by our community and learned that Google has been made aware of the vulnerability. While it remains unresolved in AOSP releases (and stock Google Android) as of the publishing of this news post, CalyxOS has released its own fix to ensure users are protected. The CalyxOS team is monitoring if this issue will be disclosed and resolved in AOSP in the near future.</p>

<h4 id="recommendation-for-affected-users">Recommendation for affected users</h4>
<p>We strongly recommend all users update to the latest CalyxOS release (6.6.22, 6.6.23 or newer) to ensure this vulnerability is mitigated. Devices running older versions remain vulnerable since potential exploitations do not need any storage access permission. 
As always, we recommend adhering to best practices for digital hygiene in general; restrict unnecessary app permissions, minimize sharing your senstive personal data with apps, and remove apps you don’t use. You can do this by exercising care when downloading apps to ensure they come from trusted sources, review individual app permissions periodically, stay cautious when you share personal data with apps, such as locations (with CalyxOS you can use <a href="https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/security/location/#strict-location-redaction">Strict Location Redaction</a> to minimize location data sharing across apps), accounts, and payment information, and remove apps you no longer need or use.</p>

<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>
<p>Individual users should update to the latest CalyxOS release (6.6.22, 6.6.23 or newer) to protect themselves against this vulnerability. The CalyxOS team will continue monitor the issue on AOSP as it remains undisclosed and unresolved by the Google team.</p>

  <li>An in-depth explanation of our decision to retire the “Restrict cleartext network traffic” feature</li>
  <li>Next steps for users who are using this feature</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>The “Restrict cleartext network traffic” setting was introduced in CalyxOS as <a href="/news/2021/04/08/big-april-update/" target="_blank">an additional layer of protection</a>,
aimed to block cleartext transmission. Cleartext transmission allows data to travel in network or communication channels without encrpytion or other protection layers.
It can occur in various types of communications, such as visiting a website, sending an email, or sharing a file.
Cleartext transmission sends data in plain, human-readable format, making it easier for unauthorized parties to read sensitive information, such as password, personal data, or private messages.
Therefore, we bulit this feature on AOSP’s existing functionality in 2021 to improve overall device data security.
However, upon review, we have discovered that this feature bears significant limitations and usability concerns.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-learned--why-we-made-this-decision">What we learned // Why we made this decision</h3>

<p>After investigating issues <a href="https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/1948" target="_blank">#1948</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/2521" target="_blank">#2521</a>,
 our finding shows that AOSP’s cleartext restriction is not a comprehensive security mechanism.
It only inspects initial packets of a connection; once Transport Layer Security (TLS) is detected, the connection will beis marked secure, and there will be no further inspection.
An app could begin sending cleartext after the initial handshake without detection.
AOSP explicitly states that this feature is meant to prevent accidental cleartext traffic, not deliberate bypasses.</p>

<p>In addition to AOSP’s functional limitations, this feature created usability problems by conflicting with other features and services, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blocking DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol</strong>: Private DNS setups using Cloudflare or Google failed silently.</li>
  <li><strong>Breaking QUIC traffic</strong>: Many modern apps rely on QUIC protocol to transmit data. Despite the fact that QUIC traffic was encrypted by default, it was blocked.</li>
  <li><strong>Interfering with VPNs</strong>: Some VPN traffic got misclassified as cleartext and blocked, affecting connectivity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these problems, continuing to maintain a “best-effort” solution, one that users might mistakenly assume is fully secure,
 risks giving a false sense of protection while breaking access to other secure services and connection protocols.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next</h3>

<p>We have already started transitioning users away from this feature:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the February CalyxOS Feature update, users who had this feature enabled received a one-time notification on their device alerting them that the feature would be removed in a future update.</li>
  <li>In the April CalyxOS Feature update, users who still have this feature enabled will again receive a notification (linking here) informing them that it has been removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of relying on this inadequate feature, you can use a VPN to protect your device’s connection and data transmission.</p>
