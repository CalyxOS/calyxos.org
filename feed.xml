  <li>CalyxOS 5.10.3 for all other devices</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>CalyxOS 5.10.0 was released to Security express on 7 August, Wednesday, 1 day after Google released the update.</li>
  <li>It had a bug, wherein SIM cards would not get detected.</li>
  <li>We released a bugfix update for that the next day, 8 August, Thursday.</li>
  <li>However, we noticed a bug with that as well. Chromium would crash for certain users.</li>
  <li>This was found and diagnosed by someone on our matrix development channel.</li>
  <li>Due to that, we didn’t roll out the update to other channels.</li>
  <li>The team was also travelling and recovering from travel at that time, further adding to the delay.</li>
  <li>The chromium bug has since been fixed, and thus we’re releasing the update (5.10.1) more broadly now.
