<h3 id="whats-included">What’s included</h3>

<p>As mentioned in our letter to the <a href="/news/2025/08/01/a-letter-to-our-community/">CalyxOS community</a>, this project has been on a hiatus for the last two months. However, we are concerned with the many existing CalyxOS users who may have not been made aware of this important change. To reach as many active CalyxOS users as we can, our team decided collectively to push one last OTA update to inform all people currently running CalyxOS about the hiatus and its impact.</p>

<p>Therefore, rather than a typical monthly update, this OTA update alerts people through a system notification that their current version of CalyxOS will no longer receive updates from our team and a link to our community letter. Once the project comes out of the hiatus, you will be alerted with an additional notification, and reinstalling CalyxOS will be required to receive updates going forward.</p>

<p>In addition, Moto and Fairphone devices will receive a patch to fix <a href="/install/antirollback-update-pending/">the issue related to the anti-rollback protection (ARB) feature</a> we discovered earlier. We hope this can provide a temporary solution to people who are seeking to run CalyxOS on these devices before they can establish a long-term plan. Note that since there will be no more updates to the existing version of CalyxOS installed on your device, future releases from the manufacturer to increment the ARB index are likely to cause the same issue mentioned above.</p>

<p>We understand that some people will continue running CalyxOS until our next release, so alongside this notification, we have included the latest open source security updates for Android 15 (although this is not a full CalyxOS security update).  This OTA update, however, is not related to our Android 16 port or the AOSP QPR1 update. We are closely monitoring the AOSP QPR1 release and working hard on bringing up Android 16 with all feature updates and security patches along with our current need to overhaul the project.</p>

 </p>

<p><strong>Update: August 27 2025</strong></p>

<p>We are concerned that some users may have not seen the important message in this letter about CalyxOS’ current hiatus. Therefore, we are rolling out one last OTA update to devices currently running CalyxOS to reach as many active users as we can. You can read <a href="/news/2025/08/27/last-ota-update-before-new-calyxos-release/">our post</a> for more details about this update.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr />

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Update: August 5 2025</strong></p>

<p>We appreciate your valid concerns and questions around the security and safety of CalyxOS.</p>

<p>First, we want to assure you that we have no reason to believe the security of CalyxOS and its signing keys have been compromised.</p>

<p>As you know, we announced a recent leadership transition. When senior personnel have access to signing keys and leave a team, it is security best practice to update signing keys and conduct audits. So in accordance with that, we are using this transition period to update our security protocols, including updating the signing keys and taking other steps to further protect our users.</p>

<p>In the past, security audits have been conducted for parts of CalyxOS, such as the <a href="https://seedvault.app/2021-security-quickscan-ros.pdf">Seedvault project</a>, but not for the entire project. As more and more people across the globe started using this tool, we intend to conduct a broader security audit and publish the reports for the public to review.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our community letter below, we estimate that this audit and the implementation of new security protocols and signing keys will take four to six months, but we will endeavor to complete this process as soon as possible. However, for the time being, current CalyxOS users will not be able to receive further security software updates until our new security protocols are in place.</p>

<p>Without security updates, we can only be honest that this does not guarantee the level of security we strive for, especially when global threats to privacy and human rights are at a critical moment. That is why in the meantime we have posted the recommendation that people who are running CalyxOS should uninstall the OS and follow our <a href="/community/">community channels</a> for updates, including when the latest version of CalyxOS becomes available again.</p>

<p>In case you wish to migrate to another custom ROM in the meantime, we’ve now published updated guides on how to back up and restore your device using <a href="/docs/guide/apps/seedvault/">Seedvault</a> and how to <a href="/install/stock/">restore your device to stock</a>.</p>

<p>We also understand that many community members have expressed interest in having an installation option/images for CalyxOS available again. Due to the overwhelming feedback from our community, we’ve decided to <a href="/get/factory">make the images publicly available</a> once more. <strong>Please be aware that this decision is not a recommendation to migrate to CalyxOS now.</strong></p>

<p>Please note that, just as current users will not receive further software updates without reinstalling CalyxOS when future updates are released, any device installing CalyxOS in the near future will also need to reinstall it. We want to ensure that all users are well informed before deciding to install CalyxOS at this time.</p>

<p>Again, we are very sorry for this development and we thank you for giving us—the project and more importantly the team—tremendous trust and support. We are doing our very best on our end, and are committed to keeping CalyxOS secure and this decision is a result of that commitment.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr />

<p> </p>

<p>Dear CalyxOS community members,</p>

<p>The last few months have been especially challenging for us as we have experienced some changes within our teams and in the Android free and open-source (FOSS) development community.</p>

<p>Nicholas Merrill, president and founder of Calyx Institute, has left the organization to pursue other projects.</p>

<p>Nick has championed privacy and data security over the last 25 years, and we thank Nick for his decades-long leadership, guidance, and contributions.</p>

<p>Chirayu Desai, the CalyxOS Tech Lead, has addressed his departure from the CalyxOS project and the organization in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CalyxOS/comments/1lxgnp8/a_personal_note/">a personal note to the public</a>.</p>

<p>We also want to express gratitude to Chirayu for his enthusiasm and incredibly hard work on CalyxOS.</p>

<p>Nick and Chirayu have been a part of the CalyxOS project and its global community for many years. Without a doubt, there is a gap to fill following their departure. 
Following their departure, there will be a period of transition as we move forward. During that time, Calyx Institute’s Interim Executive Director, Ellen McDermott, will continue to lead the organization’s important work while the CalyxOS team will focus on bridging the gap and recentering our efforts.</p>

<p>Our commitment to <a href="https://calyxinstitute.org/about">our mission</a> has not changed: defending digital privacy, advancing connectivity, and striving for a future where everyone has access to the resources and tools they need to remain securely connected. CalyxOS is an integral part of our work and stands at the center of the FOSS digital ecosystem we aspire to create. It is our responsibility to protect the privacy of current and future users of our technologies.</p>

<p>To ensure operational consistency during this transition and adhere to security best practices, our team is working to improve transparency and security through better design, communications, and infrastructure. Our ongoing priorities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upgrading the tech infrastructure supporting CalyxOS development</li>
  <li>Stabilizing update release cycles for our 25+ supported devices</li>
  <li>Revising and updating our usage and development documentation, wiki, and user guides</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>To fulfill our <a href="https://calyxos.org/community/pledge/">community pledge</a> and foster collaboration, information sharing, and inclusivity, we are engaging with our peers, partners, and security experts to ensure the delivery and integrity of all changes made during this process. After conducting a thorough inspection of the work required for successful completion of the above priorities, we have determined that it may take up to four to six months for us to provide the level of security maintenance we aim to deliver.</p>

<p>We will be switching to new signing keys along with the overhaul of the signing and verification process. As a result, current CalyxOS users will not be able to receive further security software updates until this process is in place.</p>

<p>Given the potential risk posed by the pause of maintenance and development, it’s logical that we stop providing options to install CalyxOS for now. This was an incredibly hard decision to make, and we understand that this decision may cause significant difficulties for our users.
For those wishing to remain on CalyxOS until our next release, note that you will not have the latest security patches on your device as released from the Android Open Source Project and from any proprietary sources provided by device manufacturers. We sincerely apologize for the hassle brought to you by this change, and we understand if you need to uninstall CalyxOS and migrate to another privacy-protecting Android distribution in the meantime. If you wish to continue using CalyxOS in the future, please follow our updates to reinstall CalyxOS when it becomes available again.</p>

<p>We are committed to supporting you through this process. To assist any migration, we will publish, by August 6, instructions to back up and restore your phone to a stock or custom Android distribution with Seedvault.</p>

<p>Starting with this announcement, we will be reporting our progress regularly through our <a href="https://calyxos.org/community/">community channels</a>, and we welcome your insights if you would like to contribute to this effort.</p>

<p>We thank you for your continued trust and look forward to further collaborations with people who have, are, and will be using and contributing to CalyxOS and various FOSS projects.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br />
The Calyx team</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[     ]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Community update - our progress on CalyxOS after the release of Android 16</title><link href="/news/2025/06/26/community-update-android-16/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Community update - our progress on CalyxOS after the release of Android 16" /><published>2025-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/news/2025/06/26/community-update-android-16</id><content type="html" xml:base="/news/2025/06/26/community-update-android-16/"><![CDATA[<ul>
  <li>We have analyzed the potential impact on CalyxOS that the release of Android 16 will have, and the future trends it may be imply.</li>
  <li>Given the upstream changes and internal needs, the CalyxOS team is revising our development methodologies and processes for secure and streamlined future updates.</li>
  <li>In the last two weeks, we have made significant progress in building and running Android 16 on Pixel 6 and newer Pixels.</li>
  <li>We are working to bring up the rest of modern Pixels before shifting focus to Motorola and Fairphone devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we shared in our <a href="https://calyxos.org/news/2025/06/11/android-16-plans/">previous announcement</a>, the biggest change Google made with the release of Android 16 to AOSP was to not release the Pixel device configuration sources (device trees) and its driver binaries. Because Google has been leading the development of AOSP, this move not only means that Google’s internal development progress will further impact the timelines of custom Android distributions (ROMs), but also indicates that what has previously been open to the entire free and open-source software (FOSS) community is slowly and gradually being closed.</p>

<h3 id="what-it-means-to-calyxos-future-plans">What it means to CalyxOS future plans</h3>

<p>For developing CalyxOS (and other peer custom Android ROMs) on a variety of devices, there are three key elements to ensure coherent and consistent maintenance: device kernels, device trees, and the proprietary binaries used for different components of the system. In the past, releases of Android versions usually included Pixel device trees in AOSP or otherwise made them available for download. This allowed custom Android ROM developers to easily identify the configurations Google made in new Android versions and customize them accordingly. Starting with the Android 16 release, FOSS custom ROM developers will need to build and maintain their own device trees for Pixels, which takes a lot of guesswork and reverse engineering. Comparing code changes and finding ways around proprietary codes will be a major burden in all future updates.</p>

<p>However, this impact is somewhat limited on CalyxOS. A key factor in our resilience is that CalyxOS has been supporting devices from a diverse range of phone makers besides the Google Pixels — such as Motorolas, Fairphones, and SHIFTphones — which helps us adapt to device-specific development processes and code availabilities. Furthermore, our testing has been focusing on replicating real world experience seamlessly in our development process and we will continue this effort.</p>

<p>With this trend, we are also anticipating more changes in Android 16 QPR1 or QPR2 that could potentially impact kernels — there could be features that existing device kernels are not compatible with and will require significant work to continue to support past each of these AOSP updates.</p>

<p>The trend of Google’s gradual privatization of Android OS development, albeit challenging to all custom ROM developers, has drawn attention to the importance and efficiency of tools, methodologies and processes in each stage of the development, signing and release, especially when it is happening across 20+ devices on a regular cadence, and respects the significance of quick security updates. This most recent change has prompted a close look into our current workflow. Concurrently, we are conducting a series of serious internal reprioritizations, including development (cleaning device trees, automating the extracting and matching stock properties and policies), release (preparing to make it easier for future updates), and key signing (reinforcing and ensuring key integrity, resilience, audibility, and a secure chain of trust). As a result, our users will see a hiatus in our usual schedule with respect to security and general updates. We sincerely apologize for the impact this hiatus has on users of CalyxOS, but we believe this overhaul is vital to ensuring we can put our best efforts into protecting the privacy and digital security of people who trust us by using and contributing to CalyxOS.</p>

<h3 id="what-people-should-know-with-devices-we-currently-support">What people should know with devices we currently support</h3>

<h4 id="pixels">Pixels</h4>

<h5 id="modern-pixels">Modern Pixels</h5>
<p>We have made significant progress bringing up Android 16 on all currently supported modern Pixels with GS201/GS101 chips (Pixel 6 and later models). We are cleaning up the Pixel device trees to make them easier to mantain and update in the future. Support is planned to continue despite the changes introduced by Google in Android 16. Update dates in the near future will be delayed as we adjust and improve our processes to build a sustainable and secure pipeline.</p>

<h5 id="extended-support-pixels">Extended support Pixels</h5>
<p>Pixel devices in our <a href="https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/device-support/" target="_blank">extended support category</a> will be evaluated after mainline Android 16 work is done. We will share more details once we complete the assessment of the possible kernel backport work required in the near future and feature compatibility.</p>

<h4 id="motorola-fairphone">Motorola, Fairphone</h4>
<p>We are currently focused on completing our Android 16 port to Pixel devices. Support timeline will be reviewed afterwards with updates to follow per model.</p>

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>

<p>Our next step is to consolidate the schedule for ensuing updates and share it publicly, as is expected from our community. This will include adjusting timelines for Android 16 and security updates in the near future, between now and QPR1. If you are using CalyxOS with a device mentioned above, please stay tuned on our website for the update schedule. If you are looking to start using CalyxOS today, we recommend that you kindly wait for our next update. You can reach us in our <a href="https://calyxos.org/community/" target="_blank">community channels</a> for any specific questions about CalyxOS, Android 16 and our plan. We will strive to release timely updates on our progress and plan as we have them, to our website.</p>

<p>As part of our broader mission, the Calyx Institute and CalyxOS team is committed to providing privacy-respecting tools and resources, centering on CalyxOS, that are accessible and usable by people, even as the Android landscape continues to change.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have analyzed the potential impact on CalyxOS that the release of Android 16 will have, and the future trends it may be imply.

</ul>

<p>Google has released Android 16 to AOSP, but this year’s release is different in a significant way: none of the usual source code for Pixel phones has been made available. This impacts not only CalyxOS, but the entire custom Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Here’s what we know so far.</p>

<h3 id="androids-release-model-today">Android’s release model today</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Google continues to build on the <strong>trunk-stable / quarterly platform release (QPR)</strong> model, which has evolved since Android 12.</li>
  <li>Instead of one big annual release, Android now rolls out larger and larger updates every quarter (QPRs), with features, UI changes, and improvements landing throughout the year.</li>
  <li>This model improves consistency but increases complexity—especially for downstream projects like CalyxOS. We’ve already started porting our changes to AOSP 16, but this cycle presents new challenges.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-android-16-is-different">Why Android 16 is different</h3>

<p>Android 16 was released to <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+/android-16.0.0_r1">AOSP</a> yesterday but with a one big difference than typical releases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google did not publish any device-specific source code for supported, modern Pixel devices.</strong></li>
  <li>In previous years, Google released full device trees alongside new Android versions. This allowed developers to build and boot AOSP on Pixel hardware relatively easily.</li>
  <li>With Android 16, only the platform/framework code has been released. The device trees are missing, at least for now.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means AOSP 16 cannot currently be built or run on any recent Pixel device easily just using official source. It’s unclear whether this is a delay or a policy change. Either way, it seriously disrupts custom ROM development and our porting efforts.</p>

<h3 id="calyxos-device-support-status">CalyxOS Device Support Status</h3>
<h4 id="pixel-6---9a">Pixel 6 - 9a</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Without official source code, these devices are currently unsupported for AOSP 16 builds.</li>
  <li>Pixel devices were widely supported in the custom ROM space due to their open-source friendliness (until now).</li>
  <li>We’ll need to approach them like other non-AOSP supported devices: with the GPL Linux kernel sources and updates to Android 15 device trees, which takes time and ongoing effort.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fairphones-motorolas">Fairphones, Motorolas</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We’ll look into the status of Android 16 on these devices after we’re done with porting CalyxOS changes in general to AOSP 16</li>
  <li>We’ll post an update per device once we know more.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pixel-5-series">Pixel 5 series</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We’ll look into the status of Android 16 at the end, and see what we can do, wrt extending support.</li>

    <strong>Over-the-air Updates:</strong>
    [[CalyxOS updates =&gt; updates]] are delivered over-the-air (OTA) automatically, without any manual intervention needed. However, if you'd like to manually update your CalyxOS install, see [[OTA =&gt; ota]].
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security Updates:</strong>
    The <strong>Pixel 9a, 9 Pro Fold, 9 Pro XL, 9 Pro, 9, 8a, 8 Pro, 8, Fold, Tablet, 7a, 7 Pro, 7, 6a, 6 Pro, 6</strong> contain the full security patch, as they are still being updated by Google.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security Updates:</strong>
    The <strong>Fairphone 5, 4, Motorola moto g 5G - 2024, moto g84 5G, moto g34 and g45 5G</strong> stock OS follows a different security update release schedule, which usually lags behind by a month or two compared to Pixels. The CalyxOS releases for it only contain the latest fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel. Proprietary components such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware get updates as soon as the stock OS update is available.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>End-of-life:</strong>
    The <strong>Motorola moto g52, moto g42, moto g32, Pixel 5a (5G), 4a (5G), 5</strong> are no longer being updated by the manufacturer, so the CalyxOS releases for these devices only contain the fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel. Proprietary components such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware no longer get updates.

<ul>
  <li>Some recently added CalyxOS features (<a href="https://calyxos.org/news/2025/04/25/april-feature-update/">April Feature update</a> and <a href="https://calyxos.org/news/2025/05/28/may-feature-update/">May Feature update</a>) will be unavailable,
because Google’s codebase for the Pixel 9a is older. As such, the Pixel 9a is on a different codebase than
our other supported devices, and is therefore missing some of the most recent changes.</li>
  <li>We’ve applied all relevant security patches, however, to ensure that the device remains secure.</li>
  <li>We anticipate bringing the Pixel 9a up to speed with latest features and Android 16 support in the near future.</li>

<h4 id="why-these-devices">Why these devices</h4>

<p>Making CalyxOS accessible on diverse devices is always a priority at Calyx. Within our security standards, we keep trying to support as many devices as possible for as long as we can.</p>

<p>CalyxOS requires mobile devices to unlock and relock the bootloader securely during the flashing process to prevent unauthorized root access that can compromise these devices. Among manufacturers who allow secure bootloader unlock and relock, these four Motorola phones are relatively economical compared to other mobile devices, such as Pixel phones. They also have much wider global availability. You can find these models in countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Regional reach and affordability are both important to us.</p>

<p>Additionally, there was already some custom ROM development for these models, and we contributed to their official LineageOS port. That work helps provide the device and hardware specific code CalyxOS relies on.</p>

<h4 id="pre-install-notes">Pre-install notes</h4>

<h4 id="obtaining-an-unlock-code">Obtaining an unlock code</h4>

<p>Motorola requires you to request for a code to unlock the bootloader of these phones. For brand new devices, sometimes it may take up to 3 days before the phone will let you actually enable OEM unlocking. It can be instant or sooner than 3 days as well in many cases.</p>

<p>Do note that unlocking your Motorola voids it’s warranty.</p>

<p>The CalyxOS <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">device-flasher</code> currently does not handle this process, and thus you’ll have to manually unlock the device after obtaining the code.</p>

<p>In the future, we’ll try to automate as much of it as possible.</p>

  <li>An AOSP security vulnerability allows third-party apps to bypass external storage restrictions and access sensitive folders without permissions.</li>
  <li>Google has received at least two reports of this issue, however, they have not released any public disclosure about status of the issue to this date.</li>
  <li>CalyxOS has released a fix to this issue with CalyxOS 6.6.22 and 6.6.23 in April 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>An Android Open Source Project (AOSP) security vulnerability was discovered that allowed third-party apps to bypass restrictions on the /sdcard/Android/data and /sdcard/Android/obb directories. By including “ignorable” Unicode characters (such as ‘\u200b’, a zero-width space) in the path, unauthorized apps could gain access to other apps’ external storage folders, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.</p>

<h4 id="impact">Impact</h4>
<p>The vulnerability allowed unauthorized discovery of installed apps and access to sensitive application data, which — depending on the apps’ design — could include location information, synchronization logs, and other files not intended for cross-app access. An app could use this vulnerability to explore these folders even without having any storage permissions.</p>

<h4 id="affected-devices">Affected devices</h4>
<p>This issue impacts AOSP-based devices with kernel versions 4.19 or greater, which includes all <a href="https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/device-support/">supported CalyxOS devices</a>.</p>

<h4 id="current-status">Current Status</h4>
<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in CalyxOS <a href="https://calyxos.org/news/2025/04/25/april-feature-update/">6.6.22 and 6.6.23</a>, released in April 2025. This update restores expected external storage restrictions and prevents unauthorized access via this bypass technique.
Earlier this year, the CalyxOS team was alerted to this issue by our community and learned that Google has been made aware of the vulnerability. While it remains unresolved in AOSP releases (and stock Google Android) as of the publishing of this news post, CalyxOS has released its own fix to ensure users are protected. The CalyxOS team is monitoring if this issue will be disclosed and resolved in AOSP in the near future.</p>

<h4 id="recommendation-for-affected-users">Recommendation for affected users</h4>
<p>We strongly recommend all users update to the latest CalyxOS release (6.6.22, 6.6.23 or newer) to ensure this vulnerability is mitigated. Devices running older versions remain vulnerable since potential exploitations do not need any storage access permission. 
As always, we recommend adhering to best practices for digital hygiene in general; restrict unnecessary app permissions, minimize sharing your senstive personal data with apps, and remove apps you don’t use. You can do this by exercising care when downloading apps to ensure they come from trusted sources, review individual app permissions periodically, stay cautious when you share personal data with apps, such as locations (with CalyxOS you can use <a href="https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/security/location/#strict-location-redaction">Strict Location Redaction</a> to minimize location data sharing across apps), accounts, and payment information, and remove apps you no longer need or use.</p>

<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>
<p>Individual users should update to the latest CalyxOS release (6.6.22, 6.6.23 or newer) to protect themselves against this vulnerability. The CalyxOS team will continue monitor the issue on AOSP as it remains undisclosed and unresolved by the Google team.</p>
