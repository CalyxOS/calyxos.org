* CalyxOS 6.7.20 - Android 15 is now available for the Pixel 6 - 9
* May security update (2025-05-05)
* DO NOT DOWNGRADE after installing this update

### IMPORTANT Note
* The May 2025 update for Pixel 6 (6, 6 Pro, 6a) and Pixel 8 (8, 8 Pro, 8a) devices contains
  a bootloader update that increments the anti-roll back version for the bootloader.
* This prevents the device from rolling back to previous vulnerable versions of the bootloader.
* After flashing the May 2025 update on these devices you won't be able to flash and boot older Android 15 builds.
* That includes CalyxOS, Stock Android, or any other Android.
* Trying to do so may render your device unbootable.
