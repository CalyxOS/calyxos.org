### KEY Pixel updates
* The May 2025 firmware update for Pixel 6 (6, 6 Pro, 6a) and Pixel 8 (8, 8 Pro, 8a) devices incremented the anti-roll back version for the bootloader.
* This prevents the above devices from rolling back to previous vulnerable versions of the bootloader.
* Once you flash the May 2025 update on these devices, you won't be able to flash and boot older Android 15 builds.
* That update affects CalyxOS, Stock Android OS, and all other Android distributions.
* Trying to downgrade after this update may fail and make your phone unbootable.
