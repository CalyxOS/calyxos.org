CalyxOS 4.15.0 - Android 13 is now available for Motorola Moto G32, G42 and G52.

It's known to be fully working, at this point the main things for us to do are work on improving the installation process, and handle any bugs reported.

We're also working on porting Android 14 to these devices.

Try it out and let us know things go over at [[community]].

#### Why these devices

We have always wanted to make CalyxOS accessible to as many users as possible. Which is why we keep trying to support more and more devices for a longer period of time.

These 3 motorola phones are relatively inexpensive (especially compared to the Pixels), and have much wider availability - Motorola sells phones in a lot of countries all around the world. Those 2 factors are very important to us.

Additionally, these devices already had some custom ROM developement going on, and we helped with the official LineageOS port of these devices, as that's where we get our device / hardware specific code from.
