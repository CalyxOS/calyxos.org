Happy Holidays!

CalyxOS 4.4.1 - December 2022 Quarterly Platform Release and Security update is now available for the Pixels 3 - 7, and the Fairphone 4

It's in the beta channel, and given the holidays, will stay in beta for a while just in case there's potential issues. Unlikely givne that it's only a minor bugfix release, but better be safe than sorry.

We're still investigating the issues reported in 4.4.0, mainly the random shutdowns which seem to be happening for some people.
