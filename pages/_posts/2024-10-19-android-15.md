1. Enable USB Debugging on your phone.
1. From your computer: `adb shell setprop sys.update.channel fifteen`
1. Then, on your phone: Settings -> System -> System update settings -> Check for updates

#### Fresh installs, factory images

## What about other devices?
* TL;DR: Easier to test with fewer devices, rest coming soon.
* Like last year, we decided to limit the number of devices for the first build, to make things easier for us
* We like to test every single build before release, and as you can imagine doing that for just 3 devices instead of 11 is a lot faster
* Every CalyxOS developer one of these devices. Some have 2. That makes working much easier. Not everyone has every other device.
* We figured that it'd be easier to start with a few devices, fix some bugs and then release it for all.
* Also, because of the way things are, anything that works on Pixel 6a should be fine for 6 and 6 Pro, and so on for the others too.
* We didn't want to release something too buggy / non functional.
* At the same time, no matter how much testing we do, there'll always be something we missed, so it's better to release it and get some feedback.
