title: Chromium based on Bromite
---

We've entirely reworked our Chromium fork to be based on [Bromite](https://bromite.org)

The latest stable version for Android, 102.0.5005.98 is now available in our F-Droid repo.

The previous version, 102.0.5005.78 is shipping in the June update, CalyxOS 3.6.0

### Background

We've been shipping Chromium since day one, since on Android apart from being a full browser, it also provides the WebView (used by more apps than you'd think - changelog in our Updater, DuckDuckGo Browser, many Reddit apps, etc.)

Additionally, we also ship Tor Browser

### Differences
* fewer patches for a start
* less features

### Future

#### Bromite WebView


#### Chromium version updates
Going forward, we will ensure that updates are timely.

As a first step towards this, we started on trying to port to 103 already, and opened a discussion with the upstream
