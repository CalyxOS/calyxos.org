A build with a charging fix for the Xiaomi Mi A2 has been released.

It is currently in the beta channel, and will be bumped to the stable channel tomorrow after additional testing and feedback.
Factory images will be available at that time as well.

There are no other changes, which means it's a very small update - only 609 Kb for the incremental OTA update.
