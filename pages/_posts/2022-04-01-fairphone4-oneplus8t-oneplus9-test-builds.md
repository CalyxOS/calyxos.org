CalyxOS 3.3.2 - Android 12L is now available for testing for the Fairphone 4, OnePlus 8T, OnePlus 9

These are test builds and intended for testers. Please report any issues to the testers channel.

We've tried to test everthing we possibly can, for the most part things should be fine.

Bootloader can be re-locked on all 3 devices, and OTA updates work. This should mean any other issues if found can be fixed via an OTA :)
