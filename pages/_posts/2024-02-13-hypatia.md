We're excited to announce the latest update of CalyxOS includes free/open source real time malware and stalkerware scanning.

The software that enables the malware scanning is called [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/) and is developed by [Divested Computing](http://divested.dev).
Any new installation of CalyxOS from this version forward will be offered Hypatia during the initial set-up wizard. Older CalyxOS installations can add the software from F-Droid manually.

Hypatia uses malware signatures from:

- [CitizenLab](https://citizenlab.ca/)'s research on targeted attacks on civil society organizations
- [Amnesty Tech](https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/)'s investigations in targeted threats against human rights defenders, and
- [Echap](https://echap.eu.org/)'s stalkerware database.

We hope to promote the protection of endangered groups and individuals including civil society, human rights defenders, journalists,
women and others. We also hope that this becomes the default **best practice** for makers of mobile phone operating systems
