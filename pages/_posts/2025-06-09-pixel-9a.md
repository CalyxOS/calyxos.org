* Google Pixel 9a is now officially supported by CalyxOS
* CalyxOS 6.8.10 - Android 15, QPR1, June 2025 Security update (2025-06-01)
* We welcome feedback at [[community]]

### Pixel 9a

* Some recently added CalyxOS features ([April Feature update](https://calyxos.org/news/2025/04/25/april-feature-update/) and [May Feature update](https://calyxos.org/news/2025/05/28/may-feature-update/)) will be unavailable,
  because Google's codebase for the Pixel 9a is older. As such, the Pixel 9a is on a different codebase than
  our other supported devices, and is therefore missing some of the most recent changes.
* We've applied all relevant security patches, however, to ensure that the device remains secure.
* We anticipate bringing the Pixel 9a up to speed with latest features and Android 16 support in the near future.

CalyxOS installation instructions available at [[tegu]].
