CalyxOS 4.12.0 - August 2023 is now available for all supported devices in the Security express channel.

| Release channel  | Date   |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Security express | 10 August, Thursday |
| Beta | 16 August, Wednesday |
| Stable | 18 August, Friday |

* This update was released and worked on while a lot of the team were travelling.
* As such, it was released to Security express right away, but held back from the other channels for stability, until we got a chance to test it more, collect feedback, and also be in a place to address any feedback.
* Security express channel is meant for this - to get security updates out ASAP, with minimal testing done beforehand.
* Stable will get them afterwards depending on how things go. Our goal is to test things out more, as much as we can, to provide an stable experience.

### Changelog
