CalyxOS 5.0.1 - Android 14 is now available for the Pixels 5 and newer.

| Release channel  | Date   |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Fourteen (testing) | 19 October, Thursday |
| Security express | 20 October, Friday |
| Beta | 20 October, Friday |
| Stable | Skipped due to known issues |

For Pixel 6a, testing was a week earlier, and Security express / beta were a day earlier than the above.

We're also working on supporting the Pixel 8, and porting Android 14 to the Pixel 4 / 4a after that.

### Steps
#### OTA updates for existing CalyxOS users
1. Make sure your phone is running the latest CalyxOS version 4.14.1
1. Backup your data - you can use SeedVault, the included Backup app.
1. Settings -> System -> System update settings -> Release channel -> (Beta or Security express)
1. Then, tap "Check for updates"

#### Fresh installs, factory images
1. Will be available shortly

### Pixel 6a test build mixup
* We released an Android 14 test build for the Pixel 6a last week, CalyxOS 5.0.0
* We also released a final Android 13 upgrade just after that, CalyxOS 4.14.1
* Unfortunately, that final Android 13 upgrade was also accidendally rolled out to Android 14 users, which wouldn't work given it's a downgrade. Our apologies for this.
 
#### The fix
* If you're running 4.14.1 already with your data intact, you can ignore this
* If you're on 5.0.1 already, you can ignore this
* If you're on 5.0.0 and haven't rebooted yet, you can reboot and then:
* If you're shown a screen with two options "Try again" or "Factory data reset"
* If you keep choosing "Try again" eventually it'll boot back to 5.0.0, at which point it should download and install an update to 5.0.1
