CalyxOS 3.4.0 - Android 12L is now available for all supported Pixels, i.e. Pixel 3 - Pixel 6

It is currently in the beta channel, and will be bumped to the stable channel later after additional testing and feedback. Factory images will be available at that time as well.

Newer Fairphone and OnePlus builds will be available later, with the security update and additional fixes based on the feedback.

## Changelog
* CalyxOS 3.4.0 - Android 12L
* April 2022 Security update (2022-04-05)
* Chromium: 99.0.4844.88 (version 100 work in progress)
* Calendar: Update to latest upstream version (Etar)
* Add a firewall indicator to the status bar. Shows an icon when the current app is blocked by Datura firewall.
* Firewall indicator can be turned off from Settings -> System -> Status bar -> System icons
* Fix icon shape and fonts being reset on reboot or wallpaper change.
* Hide app feature: Fix for work profile by not requiring developer options to be enabled anymore to use this feature.

### Known issues
* The firewall indicator icon is sometimes shown on the home screen - that's because the default Launcher does not have internet access
