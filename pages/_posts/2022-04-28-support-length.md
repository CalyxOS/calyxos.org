title: CalyxOS software support timeline
---

CalyxOS currently supports 12 Pixels (3 and newer), and we've got test builds available for 1 Fairphone and 3 OnePlus devices. That's a total of 16 devices.

We're also planning to add support for even more devices in the future, always trying to find more devices to which we can port CalyxOS.

Previously we've supported the Pixel 2, 2 XL and Mi A2. The last update for those was in February 2022
