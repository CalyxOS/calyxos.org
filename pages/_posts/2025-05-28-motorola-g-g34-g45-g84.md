* CalyxOS now supports 4 additional Motorola devices, in addition to the 3 Motorola devices we support
* Try it out and let us know how it goes over at [[community]]

#### Why these devices

We've always aimed to make CalyxOS accessible to as many users as possible. Thatâ€™s why we continue expanding device support and maintenance over the long term.

These 4 Motorola phones are relatively inexpensive - especially compared to Pixels - and have much wider global availability, with Motorola selling devices in many countries worldwide. Regional reach and affordability are both important to us.

Additionally, there was already some custom ROM development for these models, and we contributed to their official LineageOS port. That work helps provide the device and hardware specific code CalyxOS relies on.
