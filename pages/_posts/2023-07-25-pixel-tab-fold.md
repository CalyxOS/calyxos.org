CalyxOS is now available for the Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold.

They are currently marked as beta out of an abundance of caution. Everything should be working.

They were super easy to work with development wise (code wise they're quite similar to Pixel 7 and 7a), but just procuring them ended up taking us some time given the CalyxOS developers are spread all around the world, and these launched in a select few countries.

Try it out and let us know things go over at [[community]].
