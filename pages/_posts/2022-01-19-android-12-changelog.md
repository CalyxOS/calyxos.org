<h4>Security update notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Pixels 3a, 3a XL, 4, 4 XL, 4a, 5, 4a (5G), 5a, 6, 6 Pro contain the full security patch, as they are still being updated by Google.</li>
<li>The Pixels 3 and 3 XL are not being updated by Google anymore, so they only contain the fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel. Proprietary components such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware no longer get updates.</li>
</ul>
