* An update on how CalyxOS will provide support on each community channel
* Team support will withdraw from the Telegram channel

Dear CalyxOS community members, 

We would like to share an update on how to reach the CalyxOS team given the recent traffic insights and our internal temporary shortage of staffing. As we work hard to get the project back on track, including its community channels, we are increasingly concerned with the rapidly growing spam messages in the Telegram channel. Historically, this community channel, like every other CalyxOS community channel, has been fully administrated and moderated by volunteers and the moderator bot that was set up to bridge between the CalyxOS Matrix and Telegram channels. And the CalyxOS team tried our best to make sure they are governed under the CalyxOS [Code of Conduct](https://calyxos.org/community/code-of-conduct/) and [Community Pledge](https://calyxos.org/community/pledge/).

As we are transitioning the project, we also aim to refine our community support to make the best use of small team's capacity at the moment. To further clarify, here is a rundown of how you can seek help or support from the CalyxOS team on our community channels:
* To seek a quick answer to a technical question, the best way is to reach us in our [Matrix room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#CalyxOS:matrix.org). You can tag @calyx_institute:matrix.org to ensure a response.
* To report bug or send feature / functionality request, please start a new issue on the [Calyx GitLab](https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues). Regular triage and review will restart in mid-October.
* To follow the latest CalyxOS updates, you can check the [CalyxOS X](https://x.com/CalyxOS) and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@calyxos) accounts.
* We will also continue to sync all CalyxOS updates to the [CalyxOS subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalyxOS/) and answer questions when we have the time.

Going forward, we will withdraw our support from the Telegram channel to make sure our main channel is fully supported. However, the Telegram channel will continue to run as a entirely community-led space, however, our team is unable to moderate nor delegate moderator priviledges in those groups at this time. We thank all the admins and superusers on Telegram who have been voluntarily facilitating a democratic space for CalyxOS with our deepest gratitude.

Pleas stay tuned for our next community periodical progress report which will be coming next week!
