We're excited to announce the latest update of @CalyxOS includes free/open source real time #malware and #stalkerware scanning using malware signatures from @CitizenLab from "research on targeted attacks on civil society organizations"; @AmnestyTech "investigations in targeted threats against human rights defenders" and stalkerware database from @AssoEchap, a hacker-feminist collective that fights against the use of technology in gender-based and sexual violence.

The software that enables the malware scanning is called Hypatia and is produced by http://divested.dev. Any new installation of CalyxOS from this version forward will be offered Hypatia during the initial set-up wizard. Older CalyxOS installations can add the software from @fdroidorg manually.  

We hope to promote the protection of endangered groups and individuals including civil society, human rights defenders, journalists, women and others and we hope this becomes the default "best practice"  for makers of mobile phone operating systems
