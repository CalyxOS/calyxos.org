We're excited to announce the latest update of CalyxOS includes free/open source real time malware and stalkerware scanning using malware signatures from:

- [CitizenLab](https://citizenlab.ca/)'s from research on targeted attacks on civil society organizations
- [AmnestyTech](https://www.amnesty.org/en/tech/)'s investigations in targeted threats against human rights defenders, and
- [AssoEchap](https://echap.eu.org/)'s stalkerware database, a hacker-feminist collective that fights against the use of technology in gender-based and sexual violence.

The software that enables the malware scanning is called [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/) and is developed by [Divested Computing](http://divested.dev).
Any new installation of CalyxOS from this version forward will be offered Hypatia during the initial set-up wizard. Older CalyxOS installations can add the software from F-Droid manually.

We hope to promote the protection of endangered groups and individuals including civil society, human rights defenders, journalists,
women and others and we hope this becomes the default **best practice**  for makers of mobile phone operating systems
