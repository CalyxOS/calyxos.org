title: Android 12 update plans

Google has released [Android 12 to AOSP](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/android-12-is-live-in-aosp.html). They are yet to release the Android 12 update for the Pixels though, stating that it'll be available in the next weeks.

We have started work on porting CalyxOS to Android 12. We can port the general OS changes we make (microG, work profiles, firewall to name a few) right now, and then wait for Google to release the update for the Pixels before we can start working on having builds ready.

* Pixel 3 and above will receive the Android 12 update
* Pixel 2: Still looking into the feasibility of porting Android 12
* Mi A2: Same, we're still looking into it.
* Pixel 6: This will be supported, however it will take a while since it's an entirely new device, and it also needs 12 fully working
* Other devices: We're looking into supporting more devices, however for now we'd like to get 12 on the Pixels first.

You can follow the progress on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/CalyxOS/-/epics/28) and [Gerrit](https://review.calyxos.org/q/branch:android12). We will continue posting more updates as the port progresses.

We're also working on getting the October 2021 Security update (Android 11) out for all supported devices.
