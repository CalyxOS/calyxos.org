## FOSDEM

CalyxOS will have a stand at FOSDEM for the first time this year.

We'll have stickers, some other swag, and demo phones running the latest version of CalyxOS

## Open source contributions

CalyxOS has always believed in giving back to the open source community. We've made [[a page => opensource]] collecting some of our contributions. We'll keep adding to it.
