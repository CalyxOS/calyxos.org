The July update is here, with some new features and bug fixes all around the place.

It is currently in the beta channel, and will be bumped to the stable channel later after additional testing and feedback. Factory images will be available at that time as well.

    We will have to delay the Pixel 3 and 3 XL (blueline and crosshatch) release this month since we haven't been able to test due to a battery issue on our test devices. If you'd like to help test the build, you can contact us on the main channel, see [[community]]

<h4>Security update notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Pixels 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL, 4, 4 XL, 4a, 5, 4a (5G) contain the full security patch, as they are still being updated by Google.</li>
<li>The Pixels 2 and 2 XL are not being updated by Google anymore, so they only contain the fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel. Proprietary components such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware no longer get updates.</li>
<li>The Xiaomi Mi A2 is still getting security updates, but those are Android 10 and usually released towards the end of the month, whereas CalyxOS is Android 11 and releases the updates right as they're available. This means that the A2 lags behind slightly, by a month or two, in getting security updates for proprietary components.</li>
</ul>
