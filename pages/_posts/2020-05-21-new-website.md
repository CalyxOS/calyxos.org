Yippie! We have a new website. It is static generated and anyone can contribute through gerrit. See [[https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos.org]] and [https://review.calyxos.org/q/project:CalyxOS/calyxos.org](https://review.calyxos.org/q/project:CalyxOS%252Fcalyxos.org).

In the coming weeks, we will be adding help documentation, tutorials, release change logs, and more. Stay tuned!
