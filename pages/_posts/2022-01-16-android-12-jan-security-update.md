Thank you to everyone who tested and reported bugs, we've been able to fix most of them.

## Testers channel

We created a new testers channel for those who're interested in helping us test out the builds early.

## Pixel 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL, 4, 4 XL, 4a, 5, 4a (5g), 5a (5g)

* The builds are now available for testing.
* After receiving feedback from the tests, we will bump them to beta, and then finally, stable.
* Once they're in beta they can be installed from the phone directly.

### Steps
* Backup data on your phone using Seedvault Backup, as a precautionary measure.
* All of your data will be kept intact, but better be safe than sorry.
* From a computer with `adb` setup, run:
  `adb shell setprop sys.update.channel twelve`
* Then, on the phone, go to Settings -> System -> System update settings
  and tap on "Check for updates"
* The update should begin downloading and installing.
* Kindly report any issues on the new Testers channel mentioned above.

## Pixel 6, 6 Pro (Beta)

* Available tomorrow

## Changelog
* Mostly bug fixes, issues mentioned below
* F-Droid: Fix installation for some apps (e.g. Signal)
* Don't allow network access unintentionally when updating apps. Please verify from the Firewall app.
* Grey out networking toggles for apps without the Internet permission, as they can't use it anyway.
* Seedvault: Support DAVx5's WebDAV backend as a backup location
* Fix spellcheck when multiple languages are enabled
* Launcher: Fix colors of Personal/Work profile tab

## Issues

* We have tried to fix most of the bugs reported in testing of 3.0.0
* We will continue fixing the rest
