<strong>IMPORTANT: Don't brick your device; use device-flasher!</strong>
<p></p>
<strong>Yes, this applies to advanced users, too! Please read.</strong>
<p></p>
Our flashing tool, device-flasher (linked above), is the recommended way to install our factory
images, and it's what we test. We do not currently support installing CalyxOS via other means,
and if you try to flash your device in some other manner, it <strong>could become unusable</strong>.
<p></p>
device-flasher handles steps that the flashing scripts alone do not implement, including
device-specific steps such as unlock_critical. If not performed, or performed improperly,
your device could become <strong>bricked and unrecoverable</strong>. Follow this guide carefully
to avoid such problems.
