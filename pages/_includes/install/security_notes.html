    <strong>Over-the-air Updates:</strong>

    <strong>Security Updates:</strong>
    The <strong>Pixels 5a (5G), 4a (5G), 5, 4a, 4 XL, 4, 3a XL, 3a, 3 XL, 3</strong> contain the full security patch, as they are still being updated by Google.

    <strong>End-of-life:</strong>
    The <strong>Pixels 2 and 2 XL</strong> are no longer being updated by Google, so the CalyxOS releases for these devices only contain the fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel. Proprietary components such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware no longer get updates.

    <strong>End-of-life:</strong>
    The <strong>Xiaomi Mi A2</strong> is no longer being updated by Xiaomi, so the CalyxOS releases for it only contain the fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel. Proprietary components such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware no longer get updates. Additionally, due to a Xiaomi bug wherein updating causes the device to get wiped, we have to ship the September 2020 firmware.
