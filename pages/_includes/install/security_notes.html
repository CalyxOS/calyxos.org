    <strong>Over-the-air Updates:</strong>

    <strong>Security Updates:</strong>
    The <strong>Pixels 7 Pro, 7, 6a, 6 Pro, 6, 5a (5G), 4a (5G), 5, 4a, 4 XL, 4</strong> contain the full security patch, as they are still being updated by Google.

    <strong>Security Updates:</strong>
    The <strong>Fairphone 4</strong> stock OS follows a different security update release schedule, which usually lags behind by a month or two compared to Pixels. The CalyxOS releases for it only contain the latest fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel. Proprietary components such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware get updates as soon as the stock OS update is available.

    <strong>End-of-life:</strong>
    The <strong>Pixels 3a XL, 3a, 3 XL, 3</strong> are no longer being updated by Google, so the CalyxOS releases for these devices only contain the fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel. Proprietary components such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware no longer get updates.
