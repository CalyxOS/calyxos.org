#### Start from Stock

If you are coming to CalyxOS from another custom ROM,
[a Pixel bootloader issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/387030988)
may require you to flash back to stock using [Google's web flasher](https://flash.android.com)
in order to be able to lock the bootloader.

If your device was already running stock with a locked bootloader,
or you are not coming from another custom ROM,
you do not need to take any additional action.
