#### How do I tell if the bootloader is locked?

In [[fastboot]] "Device State: locked" means the bootloader is locked.

On the initial boot screen, you may also see this if the bootloader is unlocked:

    The bootloader is unlocked and software integrity cannot be guaranteed. Any data stored on the device may be available to attackers. Do not store sensitive data on the device.
