#### Obtaining an unlock code

Motorola requires you to request for a code to unlock the bootloader of these phones. For brand new devices, sometimes it may take upto 3 days before the phone will let you actually enable OEM unlocking. It can be instant or sooner than 3 days as well in many cases.

Do note that unlocking your Motorola voids it's warranty.

The CalyxOS `device-flasher` currently does not handle this process, and thus you'll have to manually unlock the device after obtaining the code.

In the future, we'll try to automate as much of it as possible.
