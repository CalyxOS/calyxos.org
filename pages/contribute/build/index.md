CalyxOS is Android-based, and the usual procedure to build AOSP applies. If you're already familiar and setup to build Android, you can see the short version to get a quick idea. Otherwise, the long version goes into full detail to set it up from scratch.

## Short version
* This assumes you have an AOSP build environment already setup and have built it before

Steps:
1. Initialize and sync the source code.
   * `repo init -u https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/platform_manifest -b android11-qpr1`
   * `repo sync`
2. Obtain proprietary files for your device
   * `./vendor/calyx/scripts/setup-apv.sh sunfish` (`sunfish` for Pixel 4a)
3. Build
   * `source build/envsetup.sh`
   * `lunch calyx_sunfish-user` (`sunfish` for Pixel 4a, `user` is used for release builds, you can use `userdebug` for development builds.)
   * `m`
4. Install
   * `fastboot flashall` (Run this in the same shell where you ran the build)

## Long version
* This will help you setup a build environment for CalyxOS from scratch

### [Computer setup](https://source.android.com/setup/build/initializing)

#### OS
* Linux, specifcally Debian Stable is preferred and is used for official builds
* Other recent Linux distros (Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora amongst many others) should mostly work just fine
* Windows will work too, using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
* macOS isn't supported

#### Hardware requirements
* Android building is a very intensive process, and requires a lot of resources
* Approximately 250GB of free disk space (preferably on a fast SSD), more if you want to build for multiple devices
* At least 16GB of RAM, although 32GB or 64GB will give you a much better experience, especially if trying to use the computer while building
* A reasonably fast / unmetered internet connection, as the initial source code download is quite large (approximately 50GB)

#### Install packages

For Debian Stable and other Debian based distros:
* `sudo apt update && sudo apt install bc git curl zip m4 python3-protobuf default-jdk-headless default-jre-headless libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libssl-dev`

Other distributions may have the same or similar names for packages.

You may need to run the below command to prevent some warnings when building
* `sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone 1`

### Downloading the source code

#### [repo](https://source.android.com/setup/develop#installing-repo)
repo is the tool used to download all the different CalyxOS (and AOSP) source code repositories

```
mkdir ~/bin
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```

#### CalyxOS
Now you can download the CalyxOS source code.

```
mkdir ~/calyxos/android11-qpr1
cd ~/calyxos/android11-qpr1
repo init -u https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/platform_manifest -b android11-qpr1
repo sync -j8 # You may use a higher number here if you have a fast computer and fast internet
```

This will be a big download and may take a long time. Once it's done, you can build CalyxOS

##### Proprietary files
Phones need a lot of proprietary files to boot and for all hardware to work, we have automated scripts to download and set them up.

```
./vendor/calyx/scripts/setup-apv.sh sunfish # Replace sunfish (Pixel 4a) with your device codename here
```

### Building
You made it this far! Now you can finally build CalyxOS

```
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch calyx_sunfish-user # Replace sunfish (Pixel 4a) with your device codename here, and user with userdebug if you want a debug build
m # Yes, just the letter 'm'
```

This will be the longest step, it may take hours depending on your computer. Sit back and watch it build!

### Installing
* You need to unlock your device. If you haven't done so already, you can run `fastboot flashing unlock` to unlock your device.
* After that, to install the freshly built images, run: `fastboot flashall` directly from the source code folder.

Congrats! You just compiled and installed a build of CalyxOS on your device.

## Components built outside the OS
To keep the OS build simple and fast we build some components separately outside the AOSP build system, and copy them to a `prebuilts` repository so they don't need to be built every time the OS is built. A list of those with links to build instructions:

* [Linux kernel](kernel)
* [Chromium](chromium)
* [microG](microg)

Additionally, we include some apps from F-Droid in the build process. These are the upstream binaries shipped as-is without any modifications.
