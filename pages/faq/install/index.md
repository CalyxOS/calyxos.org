### Is my computer supported for flashing CalyxOS?

* Any reasonably modern Intel/AMD computer should work.
* Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macbooks don't work.

### USB

* USB is very finicky
* We recommend using the USB cable included in the box the phone came in, or another high quality cable.
* Sometimes a different port (such as on the back of your computer instead of the front) may work better.

### OEM Unlocking

* Pixels: Verizon
* Pixels: Carrier locking (T-Mo/AT&T)
* Pixels: 6a initial build
* FP4: unlock code

### Windows USB driver

* TODO

### Linux udev

* Run flasher as sudo
