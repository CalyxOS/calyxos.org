## Donate

Your tax-deductible donation to Calyx Institute will fund our development of CalyxOS.

The Calyx Institute's mission is to educate the public about privacy in digital communications and to develop tools that anyone can use to build "privacy by design" into their internet access. By developing encryption and anonymity tools that can help users maintain their privacy, we hope to make online security easier and more accessible for everyone online.

## Translation

Missing your language, or seeing wrong strings?
Help us translate CalyxOS on [Weblate!](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/calyxos)

In common open-source fashion, we use and contribute back to many other components developed primarily by other people, these have separate translation processes. Here's some quick links on where you can translate some of the included apps and components inside CalyxOS if you choose to do so!

* [LineageOS](https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/translate), *many translations come from here*
* [microG](https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/blob/master/TRANSLATION.md)
* [F-Droid](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/)
* [Aurora Store](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/aurora-store)
* [Breezy Weather](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/#information)
* [Bitmask](https://explore.transifex.com/otf/bitmask/), *the upstream client for Calyx VPN!*
* [Briar](https://explore.transifex.com/otf/briar/)

You don't need to translate everything listed here! Translating just CalyxOS itself already helps us tremendously!
Thanks in advance for the help!
