You may have gotten a warning message that brings you to this page (**calyxos.org/lock**)
 
Relocking, just like unlocking, wipes your device. Make sure you have everything you need before continuing, our backup solution, SeedVault, may help you.

Our device flasher and web installer try to make sure that relocking is safe, and as such usually is the safest method.

Feel free to contact us at [[community]] for any questions or concerns.
