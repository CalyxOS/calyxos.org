### Security patch level

Google releases monthly security updates for Android, which contain important fixes.

CalyxOS takes those and integrates them into the OS, and releases new builds.

They can be divided into multiple parts, as each of them has to be updated separately.

Open source:
* Platform - AOSP, the open source components that CalyxOS builds on.
* Kernel - Android's fork of the Linux kernel.

Proprietary:
* Vendor - the proprietary components needed to make a device work.
* Firmware / bootloader - more of the above
