Once CalyxOS is installed on the device, it will receive frequent Over-The-Air (OTA) updates directly from our servers automatically.

## OS updates

The device automatically checks for, downloads and install updates.

A reboot is required to finish updating, you will get a notification for that.

Updates are typically done monthly, following Android Open Source Project security releases.

You can check for updates and control update settings from **Settings -> System -> Updates**.

A changelog can also be viewed there, or by tapping the update notification.
