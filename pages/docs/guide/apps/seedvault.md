**usb method**


* 1) Open your app list and tap the (insert icon here) **Backup icon**.

* 2) A prompt will appear with a list of 12 words that are your passphrase. Write this list down and then go through the verification process. 

  * It is helpful to write your passphrase in a similar format on your piece of paper.

* 3) You will be given the option to backup locally **Pixel 4a** (example device), via **USB drive** (option is greyed out without usb storage inserted), and **Nextcloud**.

  * After plugging in your usb storage, tap the middle option: **rad USB drive** , where **rad** is the name of your usb drive.

  * A screen appears (insert screenshot here) listing your backup location, an option to verify your recovery code.

 

  * The section below on **App backup** has a toggle to **Backup my apps** with the backup status listed below.

I am going to skip the experimental option and just backup my files in a different process.


* 4) With my backup up options chosen and double checked, tap the menu button top upper right corner. Tap **Backup now**

  * You can pull down from the top to look at your Notification and there will be a 
"Backup running" status bar. Give it a few minutes to complete the process.

  * Backup will be completed and it will show you the number of apps backed up out of the total apps. (7 out of 28) I tapped on the learn more options and another screen appears with a list of apps with a green check for successfully backed up or a orange caution triangle with individual descriptions why it was not backed up. 

  * Below this list is a list of apps which prevented backup.

  * Exiting out of this menu, we end up in our initial screen, titled **Backup**. Your *Backup status* should now read **Last backup: x minutes ago**.

  * Our backup is done and we can exit out of the app. Navigate your files app into the usb and locate your **.SeedVaultAndroidBackup** file.
