E-mail client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP and Push IMAP. Can do
OpenPGP encryption if https://f-droid.org/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain is installed. Settings
and account configurations can be exported so that they can be imported easily
if you are switching packages/signatures: a file manager will need to be already
installed to achieve this.
