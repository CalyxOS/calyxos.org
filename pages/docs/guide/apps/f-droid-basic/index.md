F-Droid Basic is the **preferred app store** for CalyxOS, fetching the apps from F-Droid repository. All the apps available in F-Droid are free and **open source** with no trackers or advertising.

* Install free software Android apps.
* CalyxOS gives F-Droid special privileges to streamline app updates, installs, and uninstalls.
* In addition to the standard F-Droid source for apps (aka "repo"), CalyxOS includes a source for CalyxOS apps, which allows us push out out-of-band updates for various apps when needed.
