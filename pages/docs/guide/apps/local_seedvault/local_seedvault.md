* 1) Open your app list and tap the (insert icon here) **Backup icon**.

* 2) Set your **Backup Location** as your device model that will be listed. Example: Pixel 4a 
  
  * A Warning dialogue appears, select the *use anyway* option. Device will then initialize the location.


* 3) A prompt will appear with a list of 12 words that are your passphrase. Write this list down and then go through the verification process.

  * It is helpful to write your passphrase in a similar format on your piece of paper.


* 4) The basic menu will be shown again with your backup settings. Double check that your backup location is your internal storage and 
  optionally verify your existing recovery code.

* 4) With my backup up options chosen and double checked, tap the menu button top upper right corner. Tap **Backup now**

  * You can pull down from the top to look at your Notification menu and there will be a 
"Backup running" status bar. Give it a few minutes to complete the process.

  * Backup will be completed and it will show you the number of apps backed up out of the total apps. (7 out of 28) I tapped on the learn more options and another screen appears with a list of apps with a green check for successfully backed up or a orange caution triangle with individual descriptions why it was not backed up. 

  * Below this list is a list of apps which prevented backup.

  * Exiting out of this menu, we end up in our initial screen, titled **Backup**. Your *Backup status* should now read **Last backup: x minutes ago**.

  * Tapping the `Backup status` icon brings you back to a screen with a list of your apps and how each app was or was not backed up.

  * Our backup is done and we can exit out of the app. Navigate your files app into the device storage and locate your **.SeedVaultAndroidBackup** file.
