### Transferring app data.
Different apps have different (sometimes no method) ways of saving settings, personal information, and sometimes cryptographic keys. 

We do a sample transfer process for the Signal app (included in the OS) and for the Element app (used in communication by calyx and the larger community).

*Signal*

1) Tap menu top upper right corner.
2) Settings/Chats/Chat backups.
3) Choose or create a folder for the backup and follow prompt.
4) Write your passphrase down. 
5) Tap **Create backup**

You know have a backup file located in the folder you created.

*Element* A chat client. Join our community <here> (link to community spaces section there)

1) Tap menu top upper right corner.
2) Settings/Security and Privacy/Export E2E room keys
3) Create and write down your passphrase.

Note the directory the file gets saved into. The keys will be saved in a text file with your username.

### Setting up sims for phone
Physical sim can be inserted after Calyxos is flashed. See tips and user feedback for various cel providers here (possible community built list on benefits or drawbacks to various cel providers.

Setting up esim for use on it's on or in conjunction with a physical sim for dual sim setups.
