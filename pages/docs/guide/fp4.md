If you see the below message when installing CalyxOS on your FP4 or FP5:

```
Not locking bootloader of FP4 (or FP5)
fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability returned 0
Please visit https://calyxos.org/FP4 for more information.
```

That's due to a bug with the Fairphone bootloader, which may lead to a non-functioning device.

Thus, as a precaution, we're not locking the bootloader.
