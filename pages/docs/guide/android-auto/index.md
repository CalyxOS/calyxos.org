CalyxOS 6.4.2 and newer include Android Auto. It has to be enabled from `Settings -> Connected devices -> Connection preferences -> Enable/disable Android Auto` first. 

To work properly Android Auto requires some additional apps:

- Google Maps
- Google
- Google Speech Recognition & Synthesis

They can be installed using Aurora Store. People not willing to install these apps can use app stubs ([Google Maps](https://github.com/sn-00-x/aa4mg/blob/master/system/product/app/Maps/Maps.apk), [Google](https://github.com/dylangerdaly/Gcam-Services-Provider/releases), [Google Speech](https://github.com/sn-00-x/aa4mg/blob/master/system/product/app/GoogleTTS/GoogleTTS.apk)). It is also recommended to update Android Auto app.

After that, you can connect it to your car, and follow the steps indicated. You can download the required apps from Aurora Store.
