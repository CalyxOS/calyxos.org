CalyxOS utilizes [Verified Boot](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot) (including bootloader re-locking) to keep the Android security model intact.

* \*Note that these are the current estimated dates. We try to support devices as long as possible, but it's hard to determine feasibility years in advance, so we'll keep updating these the closer we get to the dates.

### Update timeframe
* We generally intend to get monthly security updates out as soon as possible after their release. The process takes some time since we don't get early access but generally the goal is to get them out to the stable channel in the same week as AOSP release.
* Major version updates (such as the next Android 13 (T) release) take longer because we have to port all of our changes to the new version, which can be a lot of work.

### Requirements for supporting a new device
1. Android 12.0, available now, or eventually:
   <br>
   CalyxOS targets the latest Android version, currently 12.0 (S). It takes a lot of work to port a newer Android version to a device, and so devices running the latest Android version are preferred.
2. Ability to unlock the bootloader:
   <br>
   You can't install any custom OS if you can't unlock the bootloader in the first place. Some devices don't support it all, whereas on others some variants may not support unlocking the bootloader. Note that this is very different from carrier locking, which simply means that you can only use a particular SIM card with your device.
3. Ability to relock the bootloader with a custom OS installed:
   <br>
   CalyxOS is meant to be run with a locked bootloader after installation, which makes sure that the OS cannot be tampered without your knowledge.
   Additionally, this has to be implemented properly to not boot any other OS once a CalyxOS build signed with our own private keys is installed - whether it be another set of private keys, or the publicly available AOSP test keys.
4. Timely security and version updates:
   <br>
   CalyxOS pulls in Google's monthly security update as soon as they are available, however that is only the open source part. The proprietary bits need to be updated by the device vendor (Google for Pixels, Xiaomi for the A2, etc), to ensure that the device is fully up-to-date on the security patches. Timely monthly updates are thus essential, and so are Android version updates.
5. Qualcomm SoC preferred (for non-Pixel devices)
   <br>
   In our experience, working on a custom OS for a device using a Qualcomm SoC is usually much easier than the alternatives, given their wide usage, and release of open source device support code through Code Aurora Forum.

These are the 5 main factors we consider when adding support for a new device to CalyxOS.
