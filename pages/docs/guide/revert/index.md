We have a Gerrit Code Review Instance now at <https://review.calyxos.org/> !

Gerrit makes a lot easier to deal with hundreds of repositories in one place, and also 
for dealing with changes involving multiple repos.

<br>

### Setup
You will need to register on our Gerrit server and configure some settings to be able to
upload changes. Some of these configurations will be specific to the system used. This is your
"Development Machine", the computer you will be doing the work on.

#### Account
1. Visit <https://review.calyxos.org/> - and click Sign in. That will take you to
GitHub, where you can approve the request to sign in.
2. Go to <https://review.calyxos.org/settings/#Profile> - and set a Display Name, and note down
your username (it will be the same as your GitHub username).
3. Scroll down to <https://review.calyxos.org/settiRevert back to stock.
