# Buttons

All buttons by default are secondary buttons.

`.primaryBtn` assigns a button as primary. Only use one primary button per page.

`.disabledBtn` disables a button and removes any pointer events.

`.firstAction` give the button a more prominent size. This is good if there's something that a user has to do before they can progress.
