Forked from LineageOS

Things to consider
* Prompt to install apps from the local F-Droid repo. See [F-Droid#local-repo](../F‚ÄêDroid)
  * An issue with this would be that some apps may have an update right after install.
  * Another thing to do, set installer package name to F-Droid so that it can manage the app later.
* Prompt to enable microG. See [microG](../microG)
* Ask F-Droid to update the index while the setup process is going on.
