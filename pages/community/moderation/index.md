title: Moderation policy and guidelines
---

## Mjolnir

As part of our moderation, we make use of Matrix.org's [Mjolnir](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir)
tool.  The tool allows us to more easily take moderative action against individual members.
It also integrates with other lists, so that the banning of spammers in other rooms is shared to our
rooms -- this simplifies the overall moderational duties.

## WKB Policy

As part of dealing with individual members, we follow a strict policy:

- **Warn**: At first, members are warned.  This gives them the opportunity to change their behaviour,
  allowing them to cease their inappropriate behaviour in our rooms.
- **Kick**: If the user continues to post content which is not appropriate for our community, we then
  kick them as an additional warning.
- **Ban**: Finally, if the user persists in breaking our community guidelines, we ban them.

This policy may be averted for serious abuse, such as posting gore, 
However, if we believe a certain member of our community is typically helpful and informative, we do
try to give them the chance to improve their behaviour.

## Discussion of other ROMs

Discussion of other ROMs is typically not advised in our main room.  This is because we are not usually
able to debug other ROMs, and doing so would take up a substantial amount of developer and volunteering time.
However, if individual members have experience with the ROM a specific user is asking a question about,
it may be wise to direct them to the off-topic room to continue their discussion.

In the case of specific ROMs (e.g. GrapheneOS), no discussion at all is tolerated.
This is due to the drama which typically emerges as a result of said discussions.

## On and off-topic content

Off-topic content is typically directed to our [off-topic room](https://calyxos.org/community/#additional-channels).
Any discussion about CalyxOS or any related topics is usually allowed in the [main room](https://calyxos.org/community/#main-channel).

This policy is not binding and, as such, it is down to the discretion of individual moderators.
