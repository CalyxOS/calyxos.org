Welcome to the CalyxOS community. The CalyxOS community is a full community-led, volunteer-run space. The CalyxOS team is committed to provide as much support as we can. With the limited capacity of the CalyxOS team, we have a refined channel-specific strategy to provide support. Below is a full rundown of how to seek help and support from the CalyxOS team on each of our community channels. 

This community is governed by our [[code-of-conduct]] and [[pledge]]. There is also a brief community engagement guideline in the following paragraphs. Please review all of them before diving right in!

## Guidelines
* Be kind. Don't be snarky. Have curious conversation; don't cross-examine. Please don't fulminate. Please don't sneer, including at the rest of the community.
* Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.
* When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3."
* Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith.
* Eschew flamebait. Avoid unrelated controversies and generic tangents.
* Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. A good critical comment teaches us something.
* Assume good faith. (It cannot be said enough)

## Bridges for the chat channels

Matrix is the primary medium of communication. Telegram is bridged to Matrix, which means all messages get sent to both places!

* **Telegram**: Bridged using [mautrix-telegram](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/bridge/mautrix-telegram)
  * On Matrix, Telegram messages will appear just like any other message.
  * On Telegram, Matrix messages will appear to be sent by "Calyx Matrix Bridge" -> `@SepalBridgeBot`
* **IRC**:
  * Bridging has been disabled as of 2023-11-03

### Matrix Space

Matrix has a new [spaces feature](https://element.io/blog/spaces-the-next-frontier/), which lets you view all these rooms together.

We've created a [CalyxOS space](https://app.element.io/#/room/#calyxos-space:matrix.org).
