Welcome to the CalyxOS community. The CalyxOS community is a full community-led, volunteer-run space. The CalyxOS team is committed to provide as much support as we can. With the limited capacity of the CalyxOS team, we have a refined channel-specific strategy to provide support. Below is a full rundown of how to seek help and support from the CalyxOS team on each of our community channels. 

This community is governed by our [[code-of-conduct]] and [[pledge]]. There is also a brief community engagement guideline in the following paragraphs. Please review all of them before diving right in!

## Guidelines
* Be kind. Don't be snarky. Have curious conversation; don't cross-examine. Please don't fulminate. Please don't sneer, including at the rest of the community.
* Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.
* When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3".
* Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith.
* Avoid flamebait and unrelated controversies that can derail discussions. Keep conversation focused on the topic on hand. 
* Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. A good critical comment can offer valuable insight instead.
* Assume good faith. (It cannot be said enough).
