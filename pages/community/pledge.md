description: Our pledge to support the community of Android privacy and security developers
---

CalyxOS is created by the [[team -> team]] at Calyx Institute, spread across the world, united by a common belief that privacy is a fundamental human right. We do this work because we believe CalyxOS is an excellent choice for many people from all walks of life. However, because the internet is sometimes a horrible place, discussions about what software choices are right for you can turn extremely negative.

We see CalyxOS as simply one part of a large and growing community of projects working to empower people in how they use mobile technology. We are committed to fostering a spirit of collaboration, information sharing, and inclusivity in this community. We strive to lead by example in keeping our engagement with others respectful, honest, and focused on the greater good, in accordance with [our mission](https://calyxinstitute.org/about).

The Calyx Institute, and all its employees and volunteers are held to this standard. For more information, please see the [[CalyxOS contributors code of conduct => code-of-conduct]].

We denounce in the strongest possible terms any harassment of the developers of any free and open source project. We will never engage in harassment, trolling, or bad faith arguments against any other open source intitiative or any of its developers. We ask for everyone in our community to please do the same, including supporters of CalyxOS and supporters of other alternative Android ROM projects.

It is our policy to shut down any divisive discussion of other projects on any of the communication channels that we control (Reddit, Matrix, etc). We feel it is entirely counterproductive to try to pit free software projects against each other.

Some common accusations that, unfortunately, require comment:

1. **Licenses:** We have never, and will never, attempt to block anyone from using any of our code, which is all licensed free and open source.
2. **Collaboration:** As with any healthy free and open source ecosystem, there is a lot of cross-pollination in the world of alternative Android firmware. CalyxOS borrows good ideas and code from other open source projects and many other projects borrow ideas and code from CalyxOS. As it should be. We also try and send code improvements upstream to the projects we borrow it from.
3. **Attribution:** CalyxOS always preserves licensing and authorship when adapting code from other projects.
4. **AOSP Alliance:** We helped to found AOSP Alliance specifically to foster cooperation between all of the AOSP-based projects we knew of, and to eliminate wasteful duplication of effort.
5. **Politics:** CalyxOS is sometimes accused of having a political agenda. Our political agenda is that we are committed to bring the right to privacy to all people, as part of the essential rights enshrined in the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights). In keeping with this, we embrace justice for all humanity, including racial justice, the rights of women, and equity for all.
