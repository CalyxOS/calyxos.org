# Intro Sections

`.intro`. is for homepages. It makes the intro section the full height of the viewport.

`.secondaryIntro` gives the intro section a shorter height and a background color.

`.withNav` can be added to the secondary intro when secondary navigation is needed for the page. It removes the margin-bottom from the section so the navigation sits directly beneath it.

`.articleIntro` can be added to a secondary intro to give it a full-bleed image background, a serif typeface, and a heading background color. This is good or blogs or news articles.
