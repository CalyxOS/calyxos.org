    Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else
    who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional
    messaging tools such as email, Twitter or Telegram, Briar doesn't rely on a
    central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices.
    If the Internet's down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the
    information flowing in a crisis. If the Internet's up, Briar can sync via the
    Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.

    Are websites and social media apps blocked? Is your network unusually slow?
    Run OONI Probe to find out!

    With this app, you will examine the blocking of websites and instant
    messaging apps, measure your network’s speed and performance, and check
    whether systems that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance
    are in your network.

    OONI Probe is developed by the Open Observatory of Network Interference
    (OONI), a free software project (under The Tor Project) that aims to uncover
    internet censorship around the world.

    Since 2012, OONI’s global community has collected millions of network
    measurements from more than 200 countries, shedding light on multiple cases
    of network interference.

    **Collect evidence of internet censorship**

    You can check whether and how websites and instant messaging apps are
    blocked. The network measurement data you will collect may serve as evidence
    of internet censorship.

    **Detect systems responsible for censorship and surveillance**

    OONI Probe tests are also designed to uncover the presence of systems
    (middleboxes) that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance.

    **Measure the speed and performance of your network**

    You can measure the speed and performance of your network by running OONI’s
    implementation of the Network Diagnostic Test (NDT). You can also measure
    video streaming performance with the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
    (DASH) test.

    **Open data**

    OONI publishes network measurement data because open data allows third
    parties to verify OONI findings, conduct independent studies, and answer
    other research questions. Openly publishing OONI data also helps increase
    transparency of internet censorship around the world. You can explore and
    download OONI data here: https://ooni.io/data/

    **Free software**

    All OONI Probe tests (including our NDT and DASH implementations), are based
    on free and open source software. You can find OONI software projects
    <a href="https://github.com/ooni">on Github</a>. Curious to learn how OONI Probe tests
    work? Learn more <a href="https://ooni.io/nettest">here</a>.

    To receive updates from the OONI-verse,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenObservatory">follow us on Twitter</a>

    Disclaimer: Running OONI Probe might be against the terms of service of your ISP
    or legally questionable in your country. By running OONI Probe, you will connect
    to web services which might be banned. The OONI project will publish data
    submitted by probes, possibly including your IP address or other identifying
    information. In addition, your use of OONI Probe will be clear to anyone who has
    access to your computer, and to anyone who can monitor your Internet connection
    (such as your employer, ISP or government). Learn more about potential risks

    Tor is both software and an open network that helps you defend against network
    surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business
    activities and relationships.

    Orbot allows access to Tor by accessing a local SOCKS or HTTP proxy.
    On a rooted device, the proxying can be completely transparent
    i.e. the app that accesses the network need not be aware of the
    proxy's existence; you can choose which apps go via the proxy in the
    settings.

    If you don't have root access, there are some apps that are designed to work
    closely with tor or allow proxied connections:
    https://f-droid.org/packages/info.guardianproject.otr.app.im, https://f-droid.org/packages/acr.browser.lightning and
    https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mariotaku.twidere. There is also a proxy configurator addon for Firefox
    called <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/ProxyMob/downloads">ProxyMob</a> (not yet
    available from the Mozilla addon site).

    Tor Browser for Android is the only official mobile browser supported by the Tor Project, developers of the world’s strongest tool for privacy and freedom online.

    BLOCK TRACKERS
    Tor Browser isolates each website you visit so third-party trackers and ads can’t follow you. Any cookies automatically clear when you’re done browsing.

    DEFEND AGAINST SURVEILLANCE
    Tor Browser prevents someone watching your connection from knowing what websites you visit. All anyone monitoring your browsing habits can see is that you’re using Tor.

    RESIST FINGERPRINTING
    Tor aims to make all users look the same, making it difficult for you to be fingerprinted based on your browser and device information.

    MULTI-LAYERED ENCRYPTION
    When you use Tor Browser for Android, your traffic is relayed and encrypted three times as it passes over the Tor network. The network is comprised of thousands of volunteer-run servers known as Tor relays. Watch this animation to learn more about how it works:

    BROWSE FREELY
    With Tor Browser for Android, you are free to access sites your local internet service provider may have blocked.

    THIS APP IS MADE POSSIBLE BY DONORS LIKE YOU
    Tor Browser is free and open source software developed the Tor Project, a nonprofit organization. You can help keep Tor strong, secure, and independent by making a donation. Give before the end of 2019, and Mozilla will match your gift: https://donate.torproject.org/donate/donate-tbi-gp
