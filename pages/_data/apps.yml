    Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else
    who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional
    messaging tools such as email, Twitter or Telegram, Briar doesn't rely on a
    central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices.
    If the Internet's down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the
    information flowing in a crisis. If the Internet's up, Briar can sync via the
    Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.

    At DuckDuckGo, we believe the Internet shouldn’t feel so creepy, and getting the
    privacy you deserve online should be as simple as closing the blinds.

    Our app provides the privacy essentials you need to seamlessly take control of
    your personal information as you search and browse the web, no matter where the
    Internet takes you:

    * Escape Advertising Tracker Networks — Our Privacy Protection will block all the hidden third-party trackers we can find, exposing the major advertising networks tracking you over time, so that you can track who’s trying to track you.
    * Increase Encryption Protection — We force sites to use an encrypted connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes, like ISPs.
    * Search Privately — You share your most personal information with your search engine, like your financial, medical, and political questions. What you search for is your own business, which is why DuckDuckGo search doesn’t track you. Ever.
    * Decode Privacy Policies — We’ve partnered with Terms of Service Didn’t Read to include their scores and labels of website terms of service and privacy policies, where available.

    As you search and browse, the DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser shows you a Privacy
    Grade rating when you visit a website (A-F). This rating lets you see how
    protected you are at a glance, dig into the details to see who we caught trying
    to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying site’s privacy measures.
    The Privacy Grade is scored automatically based on the prevalence of hidden
    tracker networks, encryption availability, and website privacy practices.

    Our app provides standard browsing functionality including tabs, bookmarks, and
    autocomplete. In addition to strong Privacy Protection as described above, we
    also packed in some extra privacy features into the browser itself:

    * Fire Button — Clear all your tabs and data with one tap.
    * Application Lock — Secure the app with Touch ID or Face ID.

    Too many people believe you simply can’t expect privacy on the Internet. We’re
    fighting to change that, and have made it our mission to set a new standard of
    trust online. Install DuckDuckGo and take back your privacy!

    Antifeatures:
    * NonFreeNet - Uses DuckDuckGo as the exclusive search engine, for which the

    Are websites and social media apps blocked? Is your network unusually slow?
    Run OONI Probe to find out!

    With this app, you will examine the blocking of websites and instant
    messaging apps, measure your network’s speed and performance, and check
    whether systems that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance
    are in your network.

    OONI Probe is developed by the Open Observatory of Network Interference
    (OONI), a free software project (under The Tor Project) that aims to uncover
    internet censorship around the world.

    Since 2012, OONI’s global community has collected millions of network
    measurements from more than 200 countries, shedding light on multiple cases
    of network interference.

    '''Collect evidence of internet censorship'''
    You can check whether and how websites and instant messaging apps are
    blocked. The network measurement data you will collect may serve as evidence
    of internet censorship.

    '''Detect systems responsible for censorship and surveillance'''
    OONI Probe tests are also designed to uncover the presence of systems
    (middleboxes) that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance.

    '''Measure the speed and performance of your network'''
    You can measure the speed and performance of your network by running OONI’s
    implementation of the Network Diagnostic Test (NDT). You can also measure
    video streaming performance with the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
    (DASH) test.

    '''Open data'''
    OONI publishes network measurement data because open data allows third
    parties to verify OONI findings, conduct independent studies, and answer
    other research questions. Openly publishing OONI data also helps increase
    transparency of internet censorship around the world. You can explore and
    download OONI data here: https://ooni.io/data/

    '''Free software'''
    All OONI Probe tests (including our NDT and DASH implementations), are based
    on free and open source software. You can find OONI software projects
    <a href="https://github.com/ooni">on Github</a>. Curious to learn how OONI Probe tests
    work? Learn more <a href="https://ooni.io/nettest">here</a>.

    Disclaimer: Running OONI Probe might be against the terms of service of your ISP
    or legally questionable in your country. By running OONI Probe, you will connect
    to web services which might be banned. The OONI project will publish data
    submitted by probes, possibly including your IP address or other identifying
    information. In addition, your use of OONI Probe will be clear to anyone who has
    access to your computer, and to anyone who can monitor your Internet connection
    (such as your employer, ISP or government). Learn more about potential risks

    Tor is both software and an open network that helps you defend against network
    surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business
    activities and relationships.

    Orbot allows access to Tor by accessing a local SOCKS or HTTP proxy.
    On a rooted device, the proxying can be completely transparent
    i.e. the app that accesses the network need not be aware of the
    proxy's existence; you can choose which apps go via the proxy in the
    settings.

    If you don't have root access, there are some apps that are designed to work
    closely with tor or allow proxied connections:
    https://f-droid.org/packages/info.guardianproject.otr.app.im, https://f-droid.org/packages/acr.browser.lightning and
    https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mariotaku.twidere. There is also a proxy configurator addon for Firefox
    called <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/ProxyMob/downloads">ProxyMob</a> (not yet
    available from the Mozilla addon site).

    Scrambled Exif (pronounced <i>egg</i>sif) helps you remove the metadata in your pictures before you share them.

    If you feel like it.

    If you don't want the big Internet companies (or whomever) to know where your pictures were taken don't forget to remove the metadata from them before you share them.

    To remove the metadata from a picture, simply share it like you'd normally do and choose <i>Scrambled Exif</i>. A moment later, the share 'dialog' will reappear. Now just share with the app you intended to share with in the first place.

    Et voilà!

    <b>Required Android Permissions:</b>

    ★ READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to read the images other apps share with it.

    <b>Source Code</b>

    ★ This app is open source. You can take a look at the code (and contribute if you feel like it) here:

    https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif

    <b>Translations</b>

    If you wish to help to translate this app to your own language, you can do so using transifex:

    https://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif/

    <b>Misc Stuff and Facts</b>

    ★ Basically, Exif is used by jpeg, which is the format in which your Android camera saves pictures. If you want to know more about Exif, check the Wikipedia.

    ★ Scrambled Exif also renames the files (this can be disabled).

    ★ Please don't heavily rely on the data being deleted. Scrambled Exif does its job pretty well, but it could fail. Always double-check before you share.

    ★ It doesn't really <i>scramble</i> the Exif data, it deletes it. So the name is probably stupid. But I like it. The icon doesn't depict scrambled eggs either. So the icon is probably stupid. But I like it. And I also happen to be a huge fan of eggs. So this app doesn't only have a stupid name and an equally stupid icon, it is also my (non-stupid) tribute to eggs. Especially <i>huevos fritos</i>. Because I love them.

    ★ Have fun sharing your pics!

    Generate One-Time Passwords (OTPs) using a YubiKey NEO hardware, connected using

    and can be used with any other site that supports OATH HOTP/TOTP.

    There are two apps for YubiKey NEO and OATH: YubiTOTP and YubiOATH. They work
    differently, and both are supported, but to get the most features and best user
    experience we recommend use of YubiOATH. The YubiTOTP app works with all YubiKey
    NEOs, however it is more limited than the YubiOATH app. The YubiOATH app
    requires that the (free software) ykneo-oath applet has been loaded on to the
    YubiKey NEO. The YubiTOTP app is still maintained for backwards compatibility.
