    personal information as you search and browse the web, no matter where the Internet
    takes you:</p><ul><li> Escape Advertising Tracker Networks — Our Privacy Protection
    will block all the hidden third-party trackers we can find, exposing the major
    advertising networks tracking you over time, so that you can track who’s trying

    an encrypted connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes,
    like ISPs.</li><li> Search Privately — You share your most personal information
    with your search engine, like your financial, medical, and political questions.
    What you search for is your own business, which is why DuckDuckGo search doesn’t
    track you. Ever.</li><li> Decode Privacy Policies — We’ve partnered with Terms

    a website (A-F). This rating lets you see how protected you are at a glance, dig
    into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced
    the underlying site’s privacy measures. The Privacy Grade is scored automatically
    based on the prevalence of hidden tracker networks, encryption availability, and
    website privacy practices.</p><p>Our app provides standard browsing functionality
    including tabs, bookmarks, and autocomplete. In addition to strong Privacy Protection
    as described above, we also packed in some extra privacy features into the browser

    Scrambled Exif (pronounced <i>egg</i>sif) helps you remove the metadata in your pictures before you share them.

    If you feel like it.

    If you don't want the big Internet companies (or whomever) to know where your pictures were taken don't forget to remove the metadata from them before you share them.

    To remove the metadata from a picture, simply share it like you'd normally do and choose <i>Scrambled Exif</i>. A moment later, the share 'dialog' will reappear. Now just share with the app you intended to share with in the first place.

    Et voilà!

    <b>Required Android Permissions:</b>

    ★ READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to read the images other apps share with it.

    <b>Source Code</b>

    ★ This app is open source. You can take a look at the code (and contribute if you feel like it) here:

    https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif

    <b>Translations</b>

    If you wish to help to translate this app to your own language, you can do so using transifex:

    https://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif/

    <b>Misc Stuff and Facts</b>

    ★ Basically, Exif is used by jpeg, which is the format in which your Android camera saves pictures. If you want to know more about Exif, check the Wikipedia.

    ★ Scrambled Exif also renames the files (this can be disabled).

    ★ Please don't heavily rely on the data being deleted. Scrambled Exif does its job pretty well, but it could fail. Always double-check before you share.

    ★ It doesn't really <i>scramble</i> the Exif data, it deletes it. So the name is probably stupid. But I like it. The icon doesn't depict scrambled eggs either. So the icon is probably stupid. But I like it. And I also happen to be a huge fan of eggs. So this app doesn't only have a stupid name and an equally stupid icon, it is also my (non-stupid) tribute to eggs. Especially <i>huevos fritos</i>. Because I love them.

    ★ Have fun sharing your pics!
