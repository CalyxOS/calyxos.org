## Back to Stock

If you decide to stop using CalyxOS, you can return your device to its factory (stock) operating system. Instructions vary depending on your device manufactuer.

**Note:** CalyxOS cannot provide support for third-party tools or external guides. Please proceed with caution and make sure you understand the steps before beginning.

### Pixels

#### Web Installer (Recommended)

Google provides a web-based installer for returning to the stock OS, which runs directly from your browser, even from another phone. No need to install anything manually.

Visiting this link will automatically detect your device and install the latest software from Google, guiding you through each step.

#### Manual Flashing

Alternatively, you can flash factory images manually using fastboot. These are official images and instrcutsions provided by Google.

### Fairphone

Fairphone provides its own guides for reinstalling the default Fairphone OS.

### Motorola

Restoring Motorola devices to stock can be complex and varies by model; there is no official guide from Motorola. Please use at your own discretion as we have not done extensive testing. We've done our best to compile some possible options:

#### Option 1: Windows

Motorola‚Äôs official Software Fix (previously, Rescue and Smart Assistant) tool can help restore your device. Many users have reported success with this method, assuming the bootloader is unlocked. Only available for Windows.

#### Option 2: Linux

A written guide by a CalyxOS community member/moderator for flashing Motorola firmware via fastboot on Linux.
