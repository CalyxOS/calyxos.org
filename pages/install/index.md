## Try the new Web Installer

The new [CalyxOS Web Installer](https://install.calyxos.org) is here! This tool walks you through the entire installation process in simple clicks. If you are using Pixel 6 or later models of Pixels, we highly recommend that you use the Web Installer to ease your installation process.

**Please note:** Web Installer is a browser installation tool and requires WebUSB access. To ensure successful installation, avoid browsers that do not allow WebUSB access, such as Firefox and Safari.

## Choose your device model

Which device do you want to install CalyxOS on? If you don’t see your device here, check out the [[device-support]] page for complete information.

**Please note:** Pixel phones from mobile carrier Verizon in the United States are not able to install CalyxOS due to bootloader unlocking prohibitions. Read [[how to identify a Verizon phone => verizon]] to learn more.
