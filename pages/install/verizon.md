description: How to tell if you have a Pixel locked by Verizon
---

In the United States and Canada, Google Pixel phones come in carrier-locked versions or factory-unlocked versions. Whichever version you get, Google and most of the carriers allow you to enable OEM unlocking so that you can [unlock the device's bootloader](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/bootloader/locking_unlocking) to install a custom Android operating systems. However, this is not the case with Verizon.

The Verizon Pixels prohibit their users from unlocking bootloader, thus, you cannot install any custom Android OS on it. 

To check if your device allows you to unlock bootloader, you can try enabling OEM unlocking:

* **Step 1. Enable Developer Options**<br>
**Settings** &rarr; **About Phone** &rarr; tap **Build number** 7 times
* **Step 2. Enable OEM Unlocking**<br>
**Settings** &rarr; **System** &rarr; **Advanced** &rarr; **Developer Options** &rarr; **OEM unlocking**

The last step may fail if there is no internet connection. In that case, you need to connect to a WiFi network, remove the SIM card, and then try again. Once OEM unlocking is turned on, always remember to turn it back off if you don't need it.

**Please note:** If you can enable “OEM unlocking” on your device, it is an unlocked version and you can install CalyxOS. If “OEM unlocking” is greyed out, you may have the Verizon version.
