- **Issue identified:** Latest Motorola and Fairphone manufacturer updates related to the anti-rollback protection feature prevent relocking bootloaders after installing CalyxOS on certain devices for the first time.
- **Currently impacted devices:** Fairphone 5, Fairphone 4, Moto g 5G - 2024, Moto g84, Moto g34 5G and g45 5G, Moto g42, Moto g32.
- **Next steps:** We are working to ship new CalyxOS builds for these devices. Please be advised to wait for updates before attempting to install.

We have recently identified an issue with installing CalyxOS on certain devices after the latest manufacturer updates. This issue is related to Android's anti-rollback protection, which prevents downgrading to older versions of the operating system (OS). As a result, anyone attempting to install CalyxOS on the following devices may encounter problems:
* Fairphone 5 
* Fairphone 4 
* Moto g 5G - 2024
* Moto g84
* Moto g34 5G and g45 5G
* Moto g42
* Moto g32

For people using the above devices, if you are installing CalyxOS for the first time, CalyxOS won't start after relocking the bootloader.

### What you can do

If you are planning to install CalyxOS on one of the affected devices, please wait till our release of the new builds to ensure a smooth experience with CalyxOS. We have temporarily removed downloads of our factory image from our website.

If you have tried installing CalyxOS in the past few days and ran into problems in the relocking process, we recommend that you return to stock or an alternate OS for now.

We are actively working on resolving this issue and will release new builds as soon as possible.
