Fortunately, these identifiers are only available to a certain apps:\n  Operating System\n  Dialer\n  eSIM Apps\n  Carrier Apps\n  Enterprise Managed Profiles\nAdditionally, most of these device identifiers are transmitted to the mobile carrier.\nTo read these permanent identifiers, an app requires the READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE permission, which is not available to a normal app. Since Android 10, only carrier apps and system apps may have this permission. This is true of both CalyxOS and stock Android.\nMost commercial Android distributions come with carrier apps pre-installed for all the major carriers in the region where the phone is sold. These carrier apps then get automatically activated when a SIM card for that carrier is detected. This give the mobile phone carrier special access to certain phone functions, such as configuring WiFi calling. It also gives them access to the permanent device identifiers. Additionally, these carrier apps can be installed automatically by the Google Play Store.\nWith CalyxOS, there are no included carrier apps and carrier apps cannot be installed automatically.\nSerial Number\n  Scope: per-device\nSerial number of your device, determined by the manufacturer. Unlike the IMEI, this does not have to be globally unique. This number may be required when getting a warranty repair or replacement.\nTo view Serial Number:\n  Settings → About Phone → Model → Serial number\nIMEI / MEID\nScope: per-device\nTHe IMEI (GSM networks) or the MEID (CDMA networks) is a number that is globally unique for the device. It identifies the hardware of the device, unlike the SIM card which can be swapped out. It is used to connect to the carrier network, and carriers will block IMEIs that have been reported stolen.\nYour device will have one IMEI for each usable SIM card (physical or eSIM).\nLaw enforcement and intelligence services can use the IMEI to track a device, even if the SIM card changes or if you have no SIM card at all (and even if the phone is always in airplane mode).\nThe IMEI or MEID is sometimes called the “Device ID” in internal Android documentation.\nTo view IMEI:\n  Via the dialer: enter *#06#\n  Via settings: Settings → About phone → IMEI\nSIM Serial (ICCID)\nScope: per-device\nSIM cards have unique serial numbers called ICCID, which are engraved on the chip and usually printed on the outside as well. The ICCID represents the physical SIM card, where the IMSI represents the mobile customer record.\nThe ICCID is transmitted to the mobile network tower, and is logged by the carrier.\nTo view ICCID: Settings → About Phone → SIM status → ICCID\nSubscriber ID (IMSI)\nScope: per-device\nIn addition to the ICCID, every SIM card stores a globally unique subscriber ID called IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity). This number is used to identify and authenticate a paying customer to the carrier network.\nThe IMSI is transmitted to the mobile network tower, and is logged by the carrier.\nTo view IMSI:\n  Via the dialer: enter *#*#4636#*#* and then choose Phone info.\nSoftware Identifiers\nAndroid Advertising ID (AAID)\nScope: per-device\nThe Advertising ID is an unique identifier created by Google Play Services and shared among all the apps on your phone to identify you for advertising purposes. This potentially allows advertising networks to correlate all your activity across different apps on your device.\nAdvertisers are required by Google policy to use AAID as the only device identifier used for advertising purposes (Facebook identifier is still allowed, because it is tied to your account and not your device). Enforcement of this policy is lax and there is little to prevent apps from using other device information, such as your IP address, or Android ID.\nAccording to one study from 2021 of Android, 61.7% of apps directly use AAID for advertising through AdMob (owned by Google), and 87.3% of apps use Play Services and can track using AAID.\nIn stock Android:\n  The user may manually reset this Advertising ID.\n  Since Android 12, when the user turns off ad personalization, then all apps receive zeros for the advertising ID. In all prior Android versions, the app will still have access to the Advertising ID.\nIn CalyxOS:\n  Any app that tries to get an Advertising ID simply gets a random number each time.\n  There is no ability to set this to zero or reset it.\nAndroid ID\nScope: per-publisher\nAn Android ID (or SSAID), is an identifier that is unique for a give device, user (or profile), and app publisher (whomever signed the app). This means that all the apps from the same publisher on the same device will have the same SSAID.\nThere is no way to change the SSAID. Uninstalling an app or clearing the data will keep the same SSAID the next time the app is installed and run. However, if you create a separate user or work profile, the SSAID will be different for that profile or user.\nNo special permissions are needed for an app to obtain this ID. A full factory reset of the device may change the SSAID for an app (but is not guaranteed to).\nFirebase Installation ID (FID)\nScope: per-app\nThe FID is an unique ID per app that is used by an app to access certain Google Play Services. Is reset when the app data or cache is cleared, or after 270 days of inactivity. Google advises app developers against using FID as a unique identifier, because the app cache can be often cleared.\nTODO: how does microG handle this.\nGoogle Services Framework ID (GSF ID)\nScope: per-device\nIn order to use Google Play Services, an Android device must first register itself with the Google servers. This registration process happens once, and includes lots of information about the user’s Google account and device. The unique GSF ID is created by Google servers, not locally on the device.\nOnce your device registers with Google Play Services, Google stores a profile that links your user account and the hardware capabilities for your device.\nThis GSF ID is not available to apps and cannot be changed.\nIn CalyxOS:\n  If microG is enabled and “Google device registration” is on (the default), your device will register once with the Google services, supplying random information to Google (it still submits device model information). This registration number is called “Android ID” in the microG settings interface. This is needed for things like push notifications in most apps to work.\n  If microG is additionally configured with a Google account, then the device registration will include the account username.\n  Currently, the only way to reset the GSF ID is to clear the application data for microG. Doing so may cause problems with any apps that rely on microG implementation of Google Play Services (for example, you will no longer receive Signal message notifications until you also reset Signal’s app data).\nWi-Fi MAC Address\nScope: per-network\nEvery Android device has a unique identifier called a MAC address that is used for routing on the local network. Unlike an IP address, when your device contacts a remote server, the MAC address is not communicated over the internet.\nHowever, observers on the local network can, and sometimes do, use a MAC address to identify you and track you. The MAC address is communicated to a network before encryption is established, meaning anyone on the network can see your unique MAC address. For example, if you walk into a store with an open WiFi, your device might communicate the MAC address to the WiFi access point, and to everyone on the network, that in turn correlates this data with an external database to track your location.\nHistorically, the MAC address has been unchangeable and based on hardware. Since Android 10, the default WiFi setting is for the MAC address to be generated anew for each different network. There is still a single unchangeable “Device MAC Address”, but each WiFi network is given a persistent, randomized fake MAC address.\nSince Android 12, Android will sometimes re-randomize the MAC address each time it connects to a network, in certain conditions.\nInternal to the device, access to the MAC address is restricted to system applications.\nTo change the settings for a specific WiFi network go to Settings → Network & Internet → Wi-Fi → Gear Icon → Advanced → Privacy → Use Randomized MAC.\nBluetooth Address\nScope: per-hour\nLike Wi-Fi, your device has a globally unique Bluetooth address. Since Android 6, this address is unavailable to normal apps.\nWhen Bluetooth is enabled, there is something called Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) where an unencrypted presence announcement is broadcast frequently to all nearby Bluetooth devices. Fortunately, when this happens the Bluetooth address of your device is randomized (every 15-45 minutes in Android) to prevent it from being possible to track your device by these announcements (this does not happen in all Bluetooth implementations, but should for any device supported by CalyxOS).\nHowever, researchers have found a way to correlate these randomized announcements over time, thus enabling tracking via Bluetooth address. Their approach only works against Windows, Mac, and iOS, but not for tracking Android devices.\nAdditional privacy considerations with Bluetooth:\n  Location: When an app has access to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices, the Android OS considers this to be the same as granting fine-grained location permission, because the set of Bluetooth devices in range can be used to lookup your exact location in a database (such as the database Google keeps on the location on known Bluetooth devices). There is a mode where an app can scan for Bluetooth devices, but receive only a partial list if the app does not also have location permission.\n  Pairing: When you pair a Bluetooth device with your phone, that device has access to your unique and static Bluetooth address.\n  Updates: Bluetooth is a complicated protocol that is notoriously prone to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of your device. This is one of the many reasons that it is important to choose an operating system, like CalyxOS, that receives regular [[security updates => updates]].\nLinks\n  Are iPhones Really Better for Privacy?

The CalyxOS releases for it only contain the latest fixes to the open source components, such as the OS code and the Linux kernel.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity, and orientation.\nThis code of conduct applies to The Calyx Institute as a whole, including all projects that Calyx operates. It is intended to provide guidelines for contributors, volunteers, and participants in public chats and forums including Matrix community spaces. Employees and contractors of The Calyx Institute are also subject to company policies and procedures. Those people should feel free to contact HR with questions or concerns. This code of conduct is not exhaustive or complete. It is an ongoing effort to summarize our shared understanding. We want to provide a welcoming, safe environment, so we can work together to pursue powerful solutions. We reserve the right to deviate from strictly enforcing this code. Any deviations must produce an outcome which is fairer, and aligned with our values. We understand that keeping a living document relevant and “patched” involves sustained effort.\nThe Calyx Institute aims to welcome and include many different contributors from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. A safe environment means one free from abuse, whether isolated or systemic. We explicitly acknowledge that tolerating abuse is a security problem. Allowing abusers and malicious people to disrupt our community puts our software, developers, and users at risk. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\nScope\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\nThis Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project Steward has a reasonable belief that an individual’s behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.\nOur Standards\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n  Participate in an honest and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n  Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n  Attempt collaboration and dialog before engaging in conflict.\n  Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n  Respect the privacy of your fellow community members.\nThe following behaviors are unacceptable within our community:\n  Violence, sexual assault, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person, especially violence against a person or group based on a protected characteristic. (Display of weapons may constitute intimidation or a threat of violence.)\n  Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n  Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information without their consent (“doxxing”).\n  \n    Personal insults or attacks, particularly those related to:\n    \n      Experience\n      Gender identity or expression\n      Sexual orientation\n      Family\n      Relationships\n      Physical or cognitive ability\n      Personal appearance\n      Socioeconomic status\n      Body size\n      Race\n      Ethnicity\n      Age\n      Religion\n      Nationality\n      Membership in a disadvantaged and/or underrepresented group\n    \n  \n  Inappropriate photography, audio recording, or recording of personal information. You should have someone’s consent before recording these things, and before posting them publicly.\n  Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.\n  Unwelcome sexual attention: this includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.\n  Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\n  Deliberately undermining the spirit of this code while following the letter.\n  Sustained disruption of any community events, including talks, presentations, and online conversations.\n  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\nOur Responsibilities\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\nConflict Resolution\nHealthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the project’s code of conduct.\nIf you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.\nReports should be directed the project maintainer, to Calyx Executive Director Nicholas Merrill (nick@calyx.com), or to a member of the Calyx Operations Team. It is the Calyx Institute’s duty to receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct.\nWe will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone’s safety, we may take action without notice.\nAttribution\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html\nAnd also\nThe Tor Project’s Code of Conduct for, shared under a Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 4.0 International license, available at https://community.torproject.org/training/code-of-conduct/","title":"Code of Conduct","url":"/community/code-of-conduct/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"Policy\n  We intend to try and moderate less, not more.\n  The main channel #CalyxOS:matrix.org should only be used for discussion about CalyxOS.\n  Anything else should most likely be discussed in the off-topic channel, #calyxos-offtopic:matrix.org, or another appropriate channel, see [[community]]\n  No GrapheneOS discussion of any form is allowed on any of our channels, or any other places such as Reddit.

Your most intimate personal details are bought and sold, by advertisers, health insurance companies, credit agencies, and even the government.\nThese companies also have a long history of being complicit with repressive regimes by removing apps promoting democracy, censoring private and public communication, and exposing the personal information of dissidents.\nCalyxOS is different. We believe the device in your pocket should always work for your best interests. Our guiding principles include:\n  Privacy: You should have total control over your own personal data. Our guiding principle is Privacy By Design, an approach that incorporates your interests at every step of the design and development process.\n  Security: Your device should not surprise you. The meaning of security is different for everyone. Maybe you are concerned about repressive governments, censorship, surveillance, ransomware, or just your nosy friend reading your messages. Whatever is important for you, your device should not surprise you by leaking information that seems like it should be secure or exposing your device to various attacks.\n  Usability: Privacy and security are not much use if they are only available to those who are already technologically savvy. We believe that it is possible to build technology that is both easy to use and has the highest standards for protecting your data.\n  Free Software: Our goal is to help foster a diverse ecosystem of free and open source software alternatives for mobile computing. CalyxOS is only possible because we draw from, and actively contribute to, other free software projects designed for the common good.\nCalyxOS is created by an international team of [[volunteers and staff=>team]] from the Calyx Institute, a non-profit organization in New York, USA.\nThe Technology Behind CalyxOS\nCalyxOS is built upon many free software projects. The main ones include:\n  \n  \n    Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is the core backbone for all Android phones that manufacturers such as Samsung build upon. Maintained by Google, AOSP receives contributions from developers around the world.\n  \n  \n  \n    LineageOS is an alternative Android-base operating system with an emphasis on device compatibility and customizability. CalyxOS draws heavily from the LineageOS community and code.\n  \n  \n  \n    microG provides an open source re-implementation of proprietary Google Play Services. Most Android devices come with Play Services in order to provide, among other things, access to the Play Store, push notifications, advertising tracking, and location services. While some of these are great features, Play Services is also a closed, proprietary system used by Google to track your behavior. CalyxOS includes [[microG]], allowing many of the apps you love to work without Play Services.\n  \n  \n  \n    F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. CalyxOS has integrated [[F-Droid Basic]], the official client for F-Droid, in such a way that it easier to use as your primary source for mobile apps. In addition, we include [[aurora-store]], an app store that allows you to install any app in the Google Play Store.\n  \n  \n  \n    Several CalyxOS Apps are written specifically for CalyxOS to enhance usability and privacy. These include [[SeedVault]], an app for secure, encrypted backups, and [[Datura]], an app to give you fine-grained control over network access.\n  \nPrivacy By Design\nWith CalyxOS, our core principle is Privacy By Design. This is a values-driven design and development process that centers the needs of users above all else.\nWhat does this mean in practice? Some ideas in Privacy By Design include:\n  Good Defaults: There are many cases in which Android allows the user control over their data, but the options are buried deep in the settings and can be confusing to the user. CalyxOS ensures that the default option is always the option that puts privacy first.\n  Privacy-centric Design: When making design and development choices, CalyxOS puts privacy at the center of all decisions.\n  User-centric Design: We are continually asking ourselves how users will actually engage with the software and what we can do to ensure the least surprising behavior.\n  End-to-end Security: Whenever possible, we promote tools and approaches that ensure full encryption of all data for its entire life, so that no one other than you ever has access to potentially sensitive information.\nHere are a few examples of ways in which this approach makes it into CalyxOS:\n  CalyxOS does not put your data in Google’s cloud or constantly report your location to Google.\n  The CalyxOS Dialer makes it easy to upgrade your phone call using an end-to-end encrypted method, and reminds you when you are making an insecure call.\n  The default search engine and web browsers block advertising and behavior trackers.\n  We include many security-focused apps by default, such as Signal for secure messaging and Tor Browser for fully anonymous web browsing.\n  CalyxOS includes built-in free VPN services from trusted organizations protect your network traffic and IP address.\n  CalyxOS is diligent about sending your phone regular, timely, automatic security updates.\n  [[SeedVault]] uses end-to-end encryption to securely backup your phone via USB storage or the cloud.\nWho is it for?\nCalyxOS is for you 😊.\nWe design CalyxOS to meet the extraordinary privacy and security needs of frontline human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, and political and social activist groups.\nBut also, we design it to be usable and useful for everyone. Maybe you just want a simple phone that doesn’t have a lot of trackers and services that eat up battery life? Maybe you care deeply about free software? Maybe you just want more control over your digital life? CalyxOS is a great choice for you.\nIn the big picture, we have just barely started. There is so much that needs to happen before we can realize our goal of bringing usable privacy and security to everyone.\nIf you have questions, or want to contribute, [[join our community => community]].","title":"About CalyxOS","url":"/docs/about/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"CalyxOS 6.4.2 and newer include Android Auto.

Here are some noticeable differences.\n  \n    Minimal Google: The parts of Android that send your personal data to Google have been all removed.\n  \n  \n    Alternative app stores: Install open-source apps with F-Droid, or install apps from the Play Store anonymously with Aurora Store.\n  \n  Privacy enhancements when using CalyxOS:\n    \n      Tracking prevention: no apps can track you using the advertising identifier, as it is randomized on every request.\n      Better Web Browsing: the default web browser (Chromium) and the browser component used in most apps has been modified to add security enhancements and block advertising trackers.\n      Datura Firewall: an easier way to block network access for particular apps.\n      SeedVault: a secure way to back up your entire device.\n      Signal and WhatsApp: When making a call, CalyxOS encourages you to make it via Signal or WhatsApp when possible. Signal and Whatsapp offer encrypted calling and videochat, as well as text messaging, if both parties are using Signal or both parties are using Whatsapp.\n    \n  \n  Limitations & incompatibilities:\n    \n      CalyxOS does not yet include the ability to block advertising and trackers in all apps without running a third party VPN-based app or using Private DNS to block these.\n      Paid Google Play store apps usually won’t work.\n      Some free apps will not work, such as Google Wallet.\n      The built-in keyboard does not support gesture typing.\n    \n  \n  Changed defaults\n    \n      The default search engine is DuckDuckGo, an alternative to Google search. It will function similarly, but may provide slightly different results depending on the query.\n    \n  \nGetting started\nCalyxOS comes with two app stores, F-Droid and the Aurora Store.\nF-Droid\nF-Droid is the preferred app store for CalyxOS. All the apps available in F-Droid are free and open source software, and contain no trackers or advertising.\nUse F-Droid to install free software Android apps.\nCalyxOS gives F-Droid special privileges to streamline app updates, installs, and uninstalls.\nIn addition to the standard F-Droid source for apps (aka “repo”), CalyxOS includes a source for CalyxOS apps, which allows us push out updates for various apps when needed.\nAurora Store\nAurora Store is an open source, alternative way to access Google Play Store. With Aurora Store, you can download apps, update existing apps, search for apps, get details about in-app trackers, spoof your location and much more.\nAurora Store allows you to access Google Play Store using either anonymous credentials, or your own Google Account.\nWhile we recommend using F-Droid for most of your apps, certain apps like Facebook, Instagram, Google apps, and others can only be found on the Aurora Store. When in doubt, search for your preferred app in F-Droid first. If not available, it will most likely be available in the Aurora Store.\nmicroG\nIn CalyxOS, we have replaced the proprietary parts of the Android operating system that depend on Google Play Services with an open source alternative called “microG”.\nThere are many problems with Google Play Services when using a custom OS and trying to maximize privacy:\nMost popular apps do not work without Play Services installed.\nGoogle uses Play Services to gather data on how you are using your device, including location and advertisement tracking.\nGoogle tightly controls which vendors are allowed to install Play Services on new devices.\nmicroG is a open source replacement for Google Play Services (and related software), but it only includes the useful parts. Unlike Play Services, microG does not have any advertising or location tracking, for example.\nFeatures of microG:\nReduces battery, memory, and CPU usage.\nAllows you to opt-in to specific Google Services if you want.\nLocation: typically, an Android device will using WiFi and cell-towers data from Google to help determine precise location. microG does this without using Google, and without reporting your location to Google.\nNotification: most chat apps depend on Play Services to be alerted when a new message should be delivered to the user. microG allows your device to use this service from Google without the full Play Services installation.\nWhen you first start your phone, you will be given several options for the microG implementation on your device.\nWe recommend the default option, microG enabled, no Google Account, push notifications enabled.\nRead this for more information on how microG will impact your experience.\nContacts\nOptions:\nAdd an account to DAVx5\n  Launch the DAVx5 app\n  Follow the steps at DAVx5 website to configure an account\n  Once done, wait for some time and your contacts should show up in the Contacts app.\nPreferred since it syncs changes.\nCopy it from another Android phone\n  On the other phone, open the Contacts app\n  Tap Fix & Manage at the bottom\n  Tap Export to file\n  Copy the “.vcf” file to your CalyxOS phone\n  On your CalyxOS phone - open the Contacts app, then open Settings from the drawer on the left\n  Tap Import, then choose the copied “.vcf” file\nIt will only be a one-time copy.\nApplications\nApp Stores\nF-Droid - Catalog of open-source applications available for download.\nAurora Store - Download social media, Google apps, games, and other non-open source applications - A Google Play Store Client\nMessaging\nMessaging - The default SMS application.

Under each, you can control if the application allows network access. access via: background network services, Wi-Fi data, Mobile data, or VPN data.\nThe main blue toggle next to the application name will turn all of these off or on at once, or you can open the drop down menu under each app to individually control different network permissions.\nSome applications, like the Aurora store, require an all or nothing approach - either all network permissions must be on or off.\nDatura provides quick and easy access to these network controls, so you can quickly allow network access momentarily for an app, and then turn those permissions back off when not in use. Datura Firewall never changes your set preferences without your control.\nSeedVault Guide\nTo SeedVault, swipe up on the home screen to see a list of all currently downloaded apps. Open the App listed as “Backup”.\nSeedVault will require you to enter a 12 word recovery code to restore data. This is to protect you - only the you should be able to access backup data! Write does the 12-word recovery code somewhere secure to make sure you have access later.\nOnce you have entered your recovery code, SeedVault will prompt you to backup your data in one of three ways.\nSeedVault is integrated into CalyxOS and can backup application data.\nSeedvault is built into CalyxOS, providing native backups that can be backed-up to the user’s client of choice - WebDAV (via DAVx5), Nextcloud (not recommended), or a USB drive (recommended).\nNo other backup/sync client can do that on CalyxOS.\nOn stock android your only option is backing up to Google, and on iOS only iCloud.\nGoogle Camera\nCalyxOS does not come with Google Camera and Google Photos, which are included in base Android. The CalyxOS team removes as much of Google’s software as possible from CalyxOS. However, some users may want to use Google’s photo applications to best utilize the hardware of their device.\nTo get Google Photos and Google Camera:\nOpen the Aurora Store\nSearch for the Google Photos and Camera applications and download\nBefore opening either of the applications, open the Firewall app.\nThe firewall app allows fine-grain control over application network permissions.\nUnder the Google Photos and Google Camera applications, turn off all network access.\nIs Using Google Photos and Google Camera a privacy concern?\nBecause Datura Firewall blocks network access from these applications, much of the concern is removed. However, these applications are not open source. Developers and users are not made aware of what data these applications collect, how it is collected, where it goes, or who it is given to.\nBrowser choice\nCalyxOS comes with two default browser options: Chromium and Tor Browser.\nThe Chromium that comes with CalyxOS is different from Google Chrome. It is heavily modified to prioritize privacy, and is based on Cromite, a privacy focused browser with ad blocking and many anti-tracking privacy enhancements.\nFor a high degree of anonymity, you may also consider Tor Browser with the following features:\n  Better privacy than other browsers.\n  All connections run over three or more network hops to anonymize your IP address.\n  You can browse “onion sites” for heightened anonymity.\nThere can be disadvantages of using the Tor Browser:\n  Incompatible with some websites.\n  Slower to browse the web because of the extra network “hops”.\nCurious how well your browser of choice protects you compared to Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Tor, and more? See Privacy Tests for an overhead view of the various protections offered by your browser.\nMore browser options are available via F-Droid and the Aurora Store.\nCool Tips\nWork Profiles\nA work profile is available for all users on the phone. The CalyxOS team has made accessing the work profile easy. You do not need to restart or log out of the device.\nSwipe up on the homescreen to see all of your apps. Swipe left to see the apps in your work profile. These apps will not access the data from the main profile, even if they are duplicates.\nDespite the name, “work” profiles do not need to only be for your job! You can use the  work profile feature to keep a good work/life balance, maintain multiple app profiles on the same device and keep seperate versions of the same apps.\nWi-fi Timeout & Bluetooth Timeout\nCalyxOS allows for users to set automatic Wi-Fi and bluetooth timeouts. This prevents your device from being connected to networks and devices when either of these features are not in use.\nTo set Wi-Fi timeout:\n  Open Settings from the application page\n  Select Network & Internet\n  Select Internet\n  Scroll to the bottom of the page, past the list of available Wi-Fi networks if available\n  Select Network Preferences\n  Select Turn off Wi-Fi automatically\n  Select the timeout timeframe\nTo set Bluetooth timeout:\n  Open Settings from the application page\n  Select Connected Devices\n  Select Bluetooth timeout\n  Select the timeout timeframe\nUpdates\nInstalling updates is one of the most important things you can do to keep your phone  secure.\nCalyxOS provides automatic, monthly (at least), over-the-air security updates for the operating system to keep your phone up to date.\nIn order to keep apps updated, follow these steps:\n  F-Droid will notify you of app updates.\n  To make F-Droid automatically install application updates, open F-Droid, go to Settings and enable “Automatically install updates”.\n  To update apps via Aurora Store, open Aurora Store, press the “Updates” tab at the bottom, then press “Update All”.\nNote: Aurora will say that it is updating “Google Player Services” but this does nothing.\nCalyxOS Limitations - CalyxOS versus Stock Android\nCalyxOS does have several limitations. By removing Google Play services from the device, several applications will no longer work in CalyxOS:\n  Google pay (and most other payment apps)\n  Second line apps (line2, google voice, mysudo)\n  Steam, a game store site and application, does not work on CalyxOS.\nThings that do work:\n  Most popular apps will work e.g. Google Maps, WhatsApp, Uber, Lyft, Instagram, Spotify.\nNews\nCurious what changes, updates, and features are coming to CalyxOS?

The process takes some time since we don’t get early access but generally the goal is to get them out to the stable channel in the same week as AOSP release.\n  Major version updates (such as the next Android 16 release) take longer because we have to port all of our changes to the new version, which can be a lot of work.\nPreferences for supporting a new device\n  Android 15.0, available now, or eventually:\nCalyxOS targets the latest Android version, currently 15.0. It takes a lot of work to port a newer Android version to a device, and so devices running the latest Android version are preferred.\n  Ability to unlock the bootloader:\nYou cannot install any custom OS if you are not able to unlock the device’s bootloader in the first place. Some phone makers or mobile carriers do not allow all or some of their devices to unlock the bootloader. On these devices, you cannot enable ‘OEM unlocking’ to install custom OSes. Unlocking bootloader is different from carrier unlocking. The latter means you can unlock a carrier-locked phone to use SIM cards provided by other carriers on the device.\n  Ability to relock the bootloader with a custom OS installed:\nCalyxOS is meant to be run with a locked bootloader after installation, which makes sure that the OS cannot be tampered without your knowledge.\nAdditionally, this has to be implemented properly to not boot any other OS once a CalyxOS build signed with our own private keys is installed - whether it be another set of private keys, or the publicly available AOSP test keys.\n  Timely security and version updates:\nCalyxOS pulls in Google’s monthly security update as soon as they are available, however that is only the open source part. The proprietary bits need to be updated by the device vendor (Google for Pixels, Fairphone for the FP5, etc), to ensure that the device is fully up-to-date on the security patches. Timely monthly/bimonthly updates are thus essential, and so are Android version updates.\n  Qualcomm SoC preferred (for non-Pixel devices)\nIn our experience, working on a custom OS for a device using a Qualcomm SoC is usually much easier than the alternatives, given their wide usage, and release of open source device support code through CodeLinaro.\nThese are the 5 main factors we consider when adding support for a new device to CalyxOS.\nIf you know of a device that meets the above criteria, let us know!

It uses the same standard catalog of apps and installs apps directly from the Google servers.\n    \n      By default, Aurora Store accesses the Google app catalog anonymously.\n      If you want to install paid apps, or if anonymous mode is not working, you can additionally enter your Google account credentials in the Aurora Store settings (paid apps don’t always work).\n      CalyxOS gives Aurora Store special privileges so that app updates can be automatically installed. New app installs and uninstalls still must be confirmed as normal.\n    \n  \nApp Compatibility\nMany existing apps expect Google Play Services to be installed for the app to function properly. This is a problem, because Play Services is proprietary and leaks a ton of data to Google when you use it.\nThe approach that CalyxOS takes is to use something called [[microG]], which is a open source replacement for many of the services and libraries provided by Play Services.\n  microG disabled: This is the 100% de-Googled mode with no attempt to make apps work that expect Google services. Some apps will consume more battery without push notifications from Google. The presence of microG, even when disabled, will allow some apps to work that would not otherwise.\n  microG enabled, Push notifications disabled: In this mode, [[microG]] is used to implement the needed libraries to make many apps function, but in a way that does not send any information to Google. In some cases (e.g. location), privacy-respecting services are used in place of Google services.\n  microG enabled, Push notifications enabled: This is the default for CalyxOS. This is identical to the above option, with one minor change - for push notifications, Google services are used semi-anonymously (not tied to a user identity).\n  microG with Google Account: With [[microG]] enabled, you have the option to configure it with a Google account. This will allow some additional apps and services to work, such as Google Fi, but you are no longer semi-anonymous with respect to Google services.\nCheck out the Plexus App Compatibility Database. In this database, the label “de-Googled” more or less corresponds to CalyxOS with microG disabled, and the label “μ” corresponds to CalyxOS with microG enabled.\nFor more information, see [[microg]].\nIncluded Apps\nCalyxOS comes with a list of suggested free software applications to facilitate private online access but the user always has the choice whether to install or not.

We do this by using select changes from Cromite (and prior to that, Bromite). Some of these include the under-the-hood deactivation of intrusive features and analytics, while others provide additional site settings to adjust features like WebGL and WebRTC, features which are sometimes necessary but which can aid in fingerprinting or identification when turned on. We also bring in the legacy ad blocker from Bromite/Cromite to offer some reasonable protection from the worst kinds of ads. You can find and adjust these features in Settings.\nCompared to Google Chrome, a few of the things you’ll immediately notice are:\n  CalyxOS Chromium does not prompt you to sign in.\n  CalyxOS Chromium does not prompt you to adjust confusing and misleading “privacy sandbox” settings.\n  CalyxOS Chromium does not fill its new tab page with unsolicited site suggestions.\nHere are some other things you can try to confirm that CalyxOS’s Chromium is working as intended:\n  Privacy Sandbox demos by Google. Many of these demos (including Topics API and Attribution Reporting) represent new, invasive features that will not function out-of-the-box in Cromite or CalyxOS Chromium. They may be opt-out in Chrome, but they’re not even available here.\n  Adblock test by Ursu Edward (d3ward). While we don’t achieve the coveted 99%+, having AdBlock turned on (as it is by default) gets a much better score than the ~1% when it is turned off.\n  WebRTC Leak Test by BrowserLeaks. With WebRTC turned off, as it is by default in Cromite and CalyxOS Chromium, this site returns “No Leak”. With Chrome, or with WebRTC turned on (possible via the site settings, which has an address bar shortcut), more information is exposed.\nYou can view the CalyxOS Chromium change history on Gerrit or GitLab.\nWhile we do periodically assess our fork for new changes to include, we generally think that the changes we include offer a good balance when it comes to a default browser. We do not aim to compete with browsers like Cromite or Mull, but to offer a reasonable default option. That being said, users are by all means free to use whichever browser suits them, and in the November feature update, we added support for using some alternative WebViews as well.","title":"Apps","url":"/docs/guide/apps/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"Once CalyxOS is installed on the device, it will receive frequent Over-The-Air (OTA) updates directly from our servers automatically.\nOS updates\nThe device automatically checks for, downloads and install updates.\nA reboot is required to finish updating, you will get a notification for that.\nUpdates are typically done monthly, following Android Open Source Project security releases.\nYou can check for updates and control update settings from Settings -> System -> Updates.\nA changelog can also be viewed there, or by tapping the update notification.\nManual installation\nIf you’d like to manually update your CalyxOS install, see [[ota]].\nSecurity patch level\nFor more information about the security patch level, see [[bulletin]].\nApp updates\nSome of the apps included with CalyxOS are updated via F-Droid.\nYou can check for updates by opening F-Droid and pulling down to refresh.\nThis will show any available updates in the Updates tab.","title":"Updates","url":"/docs/guide/updates/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"Device support\nFor questions about device support, both for existing and new devices, as well as support timeframe, see [[device-support]].\nWhat are the goals of CalyxOS?\nWe aspire to accomplish 3 major goals  1) encrypt the content of communications as much as possible  2) take countermeasures against metadata collection  3) take countermeasures against geolocation tracking\nHow do you accomplish encrypting the content of communications?\nWe bundle network encryption applications such as Signal for voice and text messaging, Tor Browser for web browsing, Orbot for using Tor as a VPN, two VPN applications, and Briar.\nWhat countermeasures do you take against metadata collection?\nWe encourage the use of the free VPN applications, of Orbot and Tor Browser for hiding the IP address of the phone. We have a feature to optionally disable bluetooth and Wi-Fi when they haven’t been used in a while to avoid proximity tracking. We randomize the Wi-Fi MAC address (on a per network basis) to keep the use of Wi-Fi more anonymous.\nHow do you deal with the issue of geolocation tracking?\nThis is one of the hardest issues to address because of the nature of the cellular phone network. It is an ongoing problem that we hope to have better solutions for in the future, however we partially address it in several ways now: by including VPN services to cloak your IP address, by including Tor services to cloak your IP address, and by including functionality to turn off bluetooth or Wi-Fi after a user-configurable period of inactivity to prevent tracking, such as by bluetooth beacons. We also randomize the Wi-Fi MAC address (on a per network basis) as a countermeasure against tracking by unique MAC addresses.\nHow do you handle location services in a more private way?\nNormally on stock Android, location services are built into the Google Play Services. Since CalyxOS doesn’t include Google Play Services, location services are instead handled by microG. By default, we use microG’s “Remember from GPS” which uses locally acquired Wi-Fi AP and cell tower data to resolve location, we also prompt if you’d like to use an online location service, you can choose between Positon, BeaconDB, or none.\nWhat does ‘de-googled’ Android mean?\nStock Android is a combination of the underlying Android Open Source Project (AOSP) which is free software, plus a number of proprietary layers including the Google Play Services and many proprietary Google applications ( Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, Duo, Google Meet, Google Fi etc ). Because CalyxOS is a free software and privacy focused Android, we don’t include the proprietary, closed-source Google parts. This has benefits and drawbacks.  Many application developers rely on Google’s play services in order to have basic functionality such as push notifications, mapping and others.  If you simply remove Google’s proprietary layers many applications no longer work properly and some crash. To remedy this, we decided to include a free software project called MicroG whose intention is to make an open source implementation of some of Google’s services but with more enhanced privacy.\nHow is CalyxOS funded?\nThe majority of development on CalyxOS is funded by the charitable donations of Calyx Institute members! We give out free mobile internet hotspots with unlimited data plans (no throttling, no data cap, US only) to donors at ‘contributor’ level or higher: see https://calyxinstitute.org/membership for info. Additional funding for some parts of CalyxOS and/or some of the apps included with it has been generously been provided by private foundations including the NLnet Foundation, Internews, and the European Union. We have also received support from DuckDuckGo in the past and we continue to receive in-kind donations of free advertising from Google, as part of their “Google for nonprofits” program.\nHow can I back up and restore the software and data on my phone?\nWe developed a privacy focused backup and restore application called SeedVault which is built into CalyxOS. SeedVault uses encryption to protect your data before it ever leaves the phone. Currently there are two options for backing up: USB storage and cloud storage using NextCloud. SeedVault can be accessed from Settings -> System -> Backup. The first time you run it, SeedVault will generate an encryption passphrase made up of 12 words.  You must keep these words in a safe place in order to be able to restore your backups.\nWhy can’t I use call recording?\nCalyxOS uses the call recording feature from LineageOS. For legal reasons, countries where call recording would be illegal have this feature blocked. However in countries like the United States, there are states where it is legal, others where it is not. Unfortunately, there is a limitation in its implementation and we are not able to block specific states and leave out others.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","url":"/docs/guide/faq/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"How Android usually works\nWhen you use an Android device, the operating system is open source, but many of the apps depend on something called Google Play Services. This software is proprietary and tightly controlled by Google. Over time, Google has moved more and more parts of the open operating system into the closed Play Services.\nThere are many problems with Google Play Services:\n  Most popular apps do not work without Play Services installed.\n  Google uses Play Services to gather data on how you are using your device, including location and advertisement tracking.\n  Google tightly controls which vendors are allowed to install Play Services on new devices.\nmicroG to the rescue\nmicroG is a open source replacement for Google Play Services (and related software), but it only includes the useful parts. Unlike Play Services, microG does not have any advertising or location tracking, for example.\nAlthough microG is not yet a mature replacement for Play Services, the early results with microG are impressive. Most apps are able to run fine with microG without any need for Play Services.\nFeatures of microG:\n  Reduces battery, memory, and CPU usage.\n  Allows you to opt-in to specific Google Services if you want.\n  Location: typically, an Android device will using WiFi and cell-towers data from Google to help determine precise location. microG does this without using Google, and without reporting your location to Google.\n  Notification: most chat apps depend on Play Services to be alerted when a new message should be delivered to the user. microG allows your device to use this service from Google without the full Play Services installation.\nYou can check the microG wiki to see the current status of which [[ parts of Play Services have been implemented in microG => https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Implementation-Status ]].\nOptions for running microG in CalyxOS\nWith CalyxOS, you have four options:\n1. microG disabled\nYou can choose to disable microG when setting up the device for the first time.\nThis is the 100% de-Googled mode with no attempt to make apps work that expect Google services. You will receive no “push notification” using the Google infrastructure. Many apps refuse to run, however some apps such as Google Camera still work. Some apps will consume more battery without push notifications from Google. The presence of microG, even when disabled, will allow some apps to work that would not otherwise.\n2. microG enabled, no Google Account, push notifications disabled\nIn this mode, microG is used to implement some common functionality (such as maps inside some applications) to make many apps work, but in a way that does not send any information to Google. In some case (e.g. location),\nprivacy-respecting services are used in place of Google services.\n3. microG enabled, no Google Account, push notifications enabled (default)\nThis is the default and recommended option.\nThis is identical to the above option, with one minor change. Google services are used semi-anonymously (not tied to a user identity) to provide push notification functionality for many apps. This sends much less information to Google.\n4. microG enabled, with a Google Account\nWith [[microG]] enabled, you have the option to configure it with a Google account. This will allow some additional apps and services to work, such as Google Fi, but you are no longer semi-anonymous with respect to Google services.\nmicroG FAQ\nHow does microG use mtalk.google.com?\nThe domain mtalk.google.com is used by microG to receive push notifications for the device. For example, Signal uses these push notifications to know when to fetch new messages from the Signal server. The alternative to using the push notification system from Google is for every app to continually check with the server for new events, which is slower and can lead to rapid battery drain.\nSome apps, like Signal, are careful to never put any sensitive information in the push notification. In this case, the only information that is leaked to Google is the time when you received a message, but not whom the message was from or what the message contained. Other apps might put actual message content or metadata in the notification, potentially leaking this information to Google.\nIf you don’t have a Google account configured in microG, then this connection is semi-anonymous (see [[identifiers]] for more information). If you have configured a Google account with microG, then your account information is associated with each push notification.\nIs using microG a privacy risk?\nWe think of the way we have implemented microG as a ‘harm reduction’ approach: it is not 100% perfect privacy, but it is very good and still affords a solid user experience.\n  microG disabled: No information is sent to any server.\n  microG enabled: Your IP address and device model information is sent to Google (see [[identifiers]]) when microG first registers itself with Google. Similar information may be sent for location services depending on your settings, (see [[location]]). Google’s Advertising ID is completely disabled. Your device will receive push notifications from Google servers.\n  microG enabled, with a Google Account: Your Google Account name is sent to Google when microG first register itself with Google services.\nWhat is stock Android like in comparison? Everything is tracked. In one study, stock Android phones sent location data to Google 340 times during a 24-hour period. Another study from University of Edinburgh showed that even right out of the box, a typical stock Android device sends a high degree of information to numerous data brokers.\nIs microG a security risk in CalyxOS because it requires signature spoofing?\nThe short answer: No.\nThe long answer: microG does indeed require something called ‘signature spoofing’. This is the ability for one program to impersonate the code signature of another. This is needed by microG in order to impersonate Google Play Services (because most apps embed the part of Play Services in the app itself). The standard microG patch for Android to support signature spoofing simply allows it in a free-for-all style. We have instead severely controlled the scope so that it’s only allowed for one signature, for one program, microG.\nFor more technical information, see [[microg-details]].","title":"microG","url":"/docs/guide/microg/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"New content will appear here as we write up more guides.\nGetting Started\nApps📦 App stores, app compatibility, and apps special to CalyxOS\nDevice Support🙋 Check out device support timelines and preferences below!\nFAQ🙋 Get answers to some of the most common questions!\nmicroG🧘 With CalyxOS, Google Services are not running in the background, continually uploading your data and location to the Google servers.\nUpdatesHow CalyxOS stays up to date\nBug ReportingHow to report issues\nSecurityAnswers to your questions about CalyxOS security","title":"User Guide","url":"/docs/guide/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"CalyxOS is built on a dedicated server and then signed separately.

In that case, connect to a WiFi network and then try again.\nObtaining an unlock code\nMotorola requires you to request for a code to unlock the bootloader of these phones. For brand new devices, sometimes it may take up to 3 days before the phone will let you actually enable OEM unlocking. It can be instant or sooner than 3 days as well in many cases.\nDo note that unlocking your Motorola voids it’s warranty.\nThe CalyxOS device-flasher currently does not handle this process, and thus you’ll have to manually unlock the device after obtaining the code.\nIn the future, we’ll try to automate as much of it as possible.\nUnlock code link\nhttps://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a\nPrepare your host computer\nLinux packages\nThe device-flasher program needs certain udev rules installed. You should install one of the following packages to correctly set the udev rules.\nDebian, Ubuntu, & derivatives:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common\nFedora & derivatives:\nsudo dnf install android-tools\nCurrently, there are issues with udev rules on Fedora, you may need to run device-flasher.linux using sudo later on the install process.\nArch Linux:\nsudo pacman -S android-udev\nopenSUSE:\nsudo zypper install android-udev-rules\nNixOS:\nAdd the following to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and sudo nixos-rebuild switch:\nservices.udev.packages = [\n  pkgs.android-udev-rules\n];\nCreate a shell.nix for temporary FHS-compatible shell:\n{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:\n(pkgs.buildFHSUserEnv {\n      name = \"calyxos-device-flashing\";\n}).env\nEnter it with nix-shell.\nDownload device-flasher\nDownload device-flasher.linux\nSave this executable to a new directory, where you will also later save the CalyxOS image.\nVerify Digest\nThis is an optional step, useful for ensuring you have the correct device-flasher executable.

Because our location and the pattern of our movements can reveal a considerable amount of personal information about us, mobile devices have dramatically eroded our right to privacy.\nThis guide will help you develop a mental model of how cell phone location tracking works, and various steps you can take to reduce or eliminate this tracking.\nHow your phone gathers location information\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS)\nGPS is a network of satellites maintained by the US government. By reading signals from multiple GPS satellites, your device is able to calculate it’s global position with a high degree of accuracy.\nThese satellites do not record anything about your device, so GPS itself has a high degree of privacy. It is what your device then does with the GPS information that can be a problem.\nNetwork Signals\nBecause GPS can be a drain on the battery or unavailable, especially when indoors, stock Android device use Google servers to estimate your location using other methods.\nThis include:\n  Carrier Networks: what cell phone tower you are connected to and the signal strength of other cell phone towers nearby.\n  WiFi Networks: the unique identifiers of WiFi networks near by.\n  Bluetooth Beacons: the unique identifier of bluetooth devices near by.\nThe way it works is this: your device submits to Google your IP address, the nearby bluetooth and Wi-Fi network information, and cell phone tower signal strength. Google then returns with an estimate of where it thinks you probably are.\nGoogle Servers\nA stock Android device uses Google services for a variety of location functionality:\n  Google Location History: Keep a history of your location, possible forever.\n  Google Location Accuracy: Use methods other than GPS to estimate your location.\n  WiFi and Bluetooth Scanning: Use WiFi and Bluetooth information for Google Location Accuracy even when WiFi or Bluetooth are turned off.\nAll of these can be disabled, although it can be confusing to do so and many apps insist on these being turned on (for example, Google Maps will not work without Google Location Accuracy enabled).\nEven in airplane mode, your device will still record location using whatever methods are available and then upload this history to Google when you are next back online.\nIn CalyxOS, location services are handled by alternative providers instead of Google, even if you have a Google account configured with microG.\nPositon\nPositon is one of the online location services available for use in CalyxOS. It provides commercial levels of quality, therefore has higher availability and accuracy, but isn’t an open database. Their privacy policy can be found here.\nBeaconDB\nBeaconDB is one of the online location services available for use in CalyxOS. It doesn’t yet have as much data as Positon, but is an open database. It is possible to contribute to BeaconDB, for more details and their privacy policy, check their website.\nmicroG Remember from GPS\nmicroG’s Remember from GPS option builds a local database of known APs and their location, this is used for obtaining a location when GPS isn’t available, like when there isn’t a line of sight to the sky. All data stays in your device.\nStrategies for increasing location privacy\nSee Mobile Phones: Location Tracking for more information.\nAirplane Mode\nAirplane mode will turn off most radios in your device (carrier signal, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) but not NFC or GPS..\nThere are a few limitations with airplane mode.\nBaseband processor\nThere is a small mini computer inside your device that is called the baseband processor that manages all the radios. Unfortunately, the operating system for this baseband processor is proprietary and is something of a black box. Even with CalyxOS, we don’t know exactly what the baseband processor is doing.\nThere are some reports that some devices will continue to report the IMSI and IMEI identifiers to carrier towers even when the device is in airplane mode. This is specific to the hardware, and not something that CalyxOS can modify. We have not yet done testing on the various devices that CalyxOS supports to identify the specific behavior of each model.\nGPS\nEven when in Airplane Mode, your device will still receive signals from the GPS satellites unless “Location” is specifically turned off.\nAn app on your device might then keep track of your fine grain movements and then upload this history once you are back online. This is what stock Android does if location history is enabled. If you want location privacy, you should both turn on “Airplane Mode” and turn off “Location”.\nNFC\nYour phone includes NFC (Near-field Communication) in order to facilitate things like contactless payments. The range of NFC is very short, intended to be less than 4 cm.\nHowever, it is theoretically possible to build a door that can read unique NFC information when you pass through it, although there are no known products like this yet. You are probably safe leaving NFC on, but for full location privacy, you might consider also disabling NFC.\nExif metadata\nYour photos and videos contain metadata in the form of Exif tags, composed of info such as device model, the date and time the media was captured, and more. Depending on your settings, this metadata may also include location information.\nIn most Android-based operating systems, when you allow the camera app to add location tags, apps with access to media are capable of recreating your location history from the media available. To remedy this, users must either be selective about which apps can access media or turn off location tagging entirely. When location tagging has been used, it’s particularly important to use tools like Scrambled Exif to remove this metadata when sharing media.\nIn CalyxOS, location metadata is redacted by default, unless the involved apps are granted special permissions.\nStrict location redaction\nCalyxOS broadens Android’s existing media location redaction endeavors considerably to prevent unexpected leaks.\nBefore third-party apps can access this data in CalyxOS, they must be granted permission to manage media or to manage all of the device’s files. These special permissions can be managed in Settings > Apps > Special app access.\nAlthough this strict system-wide location redaction is the default behavior, it is optional, and in some situations, you may want to turn it off. For example, if you regularly share photos and would like the location data to be visible to others, you may prefer to turn this off and use a tool like Scrambled Exif when you need it, instead. (Please note that we are working to improve this use case.) It’s also possible that your preferred media gallery app was not designed to support the required special permissions, in which case you would need to turn this feature off in order to view location data in media.\nYou can control this feature using the toggle in Settings > Security & privacy > More security & privacy > Redact location data when sharing media.\nWi-Fi hotspot\nTo be written.","title":"Location Privacy","url":"/docs/guide/security/location/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"[[Install => install]] / Pixel 7a\nTerminology\n  Factory Image: This is a zip file that contains the entire CalyxOS operating system to be installed on your device.\n  Flashing: On Android devices, installing a new operating system is called “flashing,” because it writes a new factory image to the device’s flash memory.\n  Android Device: The device that you are installing CalyxOS on to.\n  Host Computer: The MacOS computer used to send commands to the Android Device.

It can be instant or sooner than 3 days as well in many cases.\nDo note that unlocking your Motorola voids it’s warranty.\nThe CalyxOS device-flasher currently does not handle this process, and thus you’ll have to manually unlock the device after obtaining the code.\nIn the future, we’ll try to automate as much of it as possible.\nUnlock code link\nhttps://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a\nPrepare your host computer\nMacOS Settings\nAs a safety measure, your computer probably has Gategeeker enabled in order to prevent you from running unknown software like device-flasher.\nIn order to continue with the installation, you may have to temporarily disable Gatekeeper. See How to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer for more information.\nInstallation from the M1 Macs is currently not supported due to an incompatibility with the fastboot tool used for flashing and the ARM64 M1 Macs. Intel Macs should work fine.\nDownload device-flasher\nDownload device-flasher.darwin\nSave this executable to a new directory, where you will also later save the CalyxOS image.\nVerify Digest\nThis is an optional step, useful for ensuring you have the correct device-flasher executable. Open a terminal on your host computer, change to the directory where you saved device-flasher, and then run:\nshasum -a 256 device-flasher.darwin\nAnd ensure the result says 10c7e8c6431a635e3ce9daccf2ab959c44000ab0513e11315f92124069a8212f. This is the unique digest of the device-flasher. If it doesn’t match, then you have a corrupted or incorrect file.\nVerify Signature\nFor the highest level of confidence, you can optionally download the signature file and then [[verify it => verify]].\nDownload factory image\nDownload CalyxOS Image\nSave this image in the same directory as device-flasher. This image will only work for moto g32 (devon). Any attempt to install this image on a different device model may brick (destroy) the Android device.\nDo not extract or rename the zip, simply copy it as-is.\nOnce downloaded, the next step is to verify the image. This step is optional, but verification helps ensure that you downloaded the image correctly, and that you got the correct image.\nVerify Digest\nTo verify the image, open a terminal window on the host computer where you saved the image and run the command:\nshasum -a 256 devon-factory-25607212.zip\nAnd ensure the result says 813d155c0dbdc90a49c803c7087e7a348130d4e0b99a88d7403844baa1dfcc18.

Ensure that both the CalyxOS image and device-flasher are in the same directory.\nRun device-flasher per the below instructions and then follow the steps shown on the computer screen.\nOpen a terminal, change to the directory with the firmware image, and run:\nchmod +x device-flasher.darwin\n./device-flasher.darwin\nUnlock the bootloader\nAt some point in the installation process, it will ask you to unlock the bootloader.\nNOTE: if the bootloader is already unlocked, you will not see the unlock bootloader menu and installation will proceed automatically without you needing to touch anything.\nThe bootloader unlock menu looks like this:\nPress a volume key to select UNLOCK THE BOOTLOADER option. Then press the power key to activate that option.\nSuccess?\nOnce device-flasher is finished, you should now have a fully functional CalyxOS device. If not, please see our [[community]] page for where you can post your questions.\nTroubleshooting\nError running device-flasher\nIf you get a mysterious error when running device-flasher, or if device-flasher hangs, it may be a USB problem. Try connecting to a different USB port on your computer (yes, not all USB ports are created equal) or a different USB cable.\nHow do I tell if the bootloader is locked?\nIn [[fastboot]] “Device State: locked” means the bootloader is locked.\nOn the initial boot screen, you may also see this if the bootloader is unlocked:\nThe bootloader is unlocked and software integrity cannot be guaranteed. Any data stored on the device may be available to attackers.

In some cases, use of Google servers is required in order to support important functionality. In other cases, alternatives do exist, such as for updating the internal clock, but we feel that using Google servers anonymously still protects users’ privacy.\nWe continue to research and implement ways to give the user greater control over the use of Google services.\n  Domain\n  Purpose\n  connectivitycheck.gstatic.com\n  CalyxOS connects to this Google service to determine if the device can connect to the internet. If that domain is unreachable, it may also try www.google.com, play.googleapis.com, or (in China only) www.googleapis.cn. This can be turned off from Settings -> Network & internet -> Connectivity check\n  time.android.com\n  CalyxOS connects to this Google service to synchronize the device's internal clock.\n  android.clients.google.com\n  Used by microG to register the device with Google in order to obtain an identifier that is needed for push notification. As much as possible, microG sends little identifiable information to Google in this process (although it does submit device model, and your Google username if you have chosen to configure microG with your actual Google account).\n  supl.google.com\n  SUPL is an optional assistive GPS (A-GPS) service that allows the device to much more quickly get a GPS lock. When A-GPS is turned on, the request for GPS satellite information that CalyxOS makes to Google servers utilizes TLS and does not include the device's IMSI or phone number unless an emergency call is made.\n  remoteprovisioning.googleapis.com\n  Used for Remote Key Provisioning, a feature of Android's key attestation system. See below for more details.\nApp connections\nThese connections are made by apps in the default CalyxOS configuration. You can prevent these connections by removing or disabling the app.\n  Domain\n  App\n  Purpose\n  f-droid.org\n  [[F-Droid Basic]]\n  The app repository for F-Droid, the preferred and default app store for CalyxOS.

This repository has highest priority and we use it to push out security fixes, necessary updates, and our own version of some apps that also exist in F-Droid.\n  mtalk.google.com\n  [[microG]]\n  If you have [[microG]] enabled, this service is used to receive push notifications (see below).\n  goolag.store\n  [[Aurora Store]]\n  If you use Aurora Store with anonymous credentials, it uses this service to grab the credentials.\n  gitlab.com\n  [[Aurora Store]]\n  Aurora Store will connect to gitlab.com to check if there is a new version of Aurora Store and to load the current Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n  android.clients.google.com\n  [[Aurora Store]]\n  Aurora Store will connect to this Google service in order to obtain an access token needed to access the Google Play Store catalog of apps.\n  play-lh.googleusercontent.com\n  [[Aurora Store]]\n  Aurora Store will connect to this Google service in order to load content from the Google Play Store.\nFurther details\nHow does Calyx Institute use the data collected by releases.calyxinstitute.org?\nWe retain per-request logs for a short period of time before these logs are aggregated and destroyed. The per-request logs may include IP address, country of origin, and device model. The aggregated long term data includes total counts of requests by country and by device model.\nPer-request logs are kept strictly private without Calyx Institute.\nWhy does CalyxOS still use servers run by Google?\nWe have considered replacing Google servers for updating the system time and for connectivity check but decided against it. Our position is that using Google servers provides better privacy in this situation by allowing CalyxOS users to hide among the crowd of every other Android device on earth. Imagine if every CalyxOS device was using non-standard servers for these core functions. If we did this, it would be trivially easy for a repressive state to instantly identify all the people running CalyxOS devices and potentially target them for scrutiny.\nAdditionally, in the case of connectivity check and time updates, Google does not get any meaningful information from your device. It can be turned off from Settings -> Network & internet -> Connectivity check\nIn the future, we may allow further configuration of these settings, although we still advise against doing so.\nCalyxOS is not currently designed to operate in a “stealth mode” where a network observer could not detect that a device was running CalyxOS. However, in order to keep that open as a possibility for the future, we don’t want to make this harder by replacing all the standard servers with bespoke servers run by Calyx.\nWhat is Qualcomm doing?\nWe don’t exactly know, because this is handled inside the baseband processor (a separate computer on your device that handles all the radios and wireless networking). The domain xtrapath1.izatcloud.net is used by the baseband to load a data file of GPS satellite positions. Unfortunately, this data is downloaded over plain text HTTP, and it’s use and parsing is handled by the “black box” of the baseband, which runs proprietary software and which we have no visibility into what it is actually doing.\nThis is from the Qualcomm privacy notice:\n  The Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service downloads to your device a data file from QTI containing the predicted orbits of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites. The Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service also uploads a small amount of data to us comprised of: a randomly generated unique software ID that is not associated to you or to other IDs, the chipset name and serial number, the Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service software version, the mobile country code(s) and network code(s) (allowing identification of country and wireless operator), the type of operating system and version, device make and model, the date and time of connection to the server, the time since the last boot of the application processor and modem, and a list of QTI software on the device\nIn the future, we may choose to block this domain, causing longer initial location resolution when using GPS.\nWhat are Key Attestation and Remote Key Provisioning?\nKey attestation is a system meant to “ensure the integrity of the device and apps running on the device” (source: Google Security Blog). Remote Key Provisioning is a sub-feature which ensures that claims made by compromised OS versions are considered invalid, and also that devices are able to recover their genuine status when newer, uncompromised OS versions are installed. This feature depends on Google servers and is primarily useful in combination with microG and services like SafetyNet, Identity Credential, and Digital Car Key.\nThis system relies on Google, but is fairly well designed:\n  The scheme is privacy preserving in that each application receives a different attestation key, and the keys themselves are rotated regularly. Additionally, Google backend servers are segmented such that the server which verifies the device’s public key does not see the attached attestation keys. This means it is not possible for Google to correlate attestation keys back to a particular device that requested them.\nRecent research has highlighted that Android still communicates with Google as part of the Remote Key Provisioning system, even in the absence of microG or Google Play services. CalyxOS is currently looking into this issue and considering ways to address it.","title":"Network Activity","url":"/docs/guide/security/network-activity/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"A safe home for all your data.

Whichever version you get, Google and most of the carriers allow you to enable OEM unlocking so that you can unlock the device’s bootloader to install a custom Android operating systems. However, this is not the case with Verizon.\nThe Verizon Pixels prohibit their users from unlocking bootloader, thus, you cannot install any custom Android OS on it.\nTo check if your device allows you to unlock the bootloader, you can try enabling OEM unlocking:\n  Step 1. Enable Developer Options\nSettings → About Phone → tap Build number 7 times\n  Step 2. Enable OEM Unlocking\nSettings → System → Advanced → Developer Options → OEM unlocking\nThe last step may fail if there is no internet connection. In that case, you need to connect to a Wi-Fi network, remove the SIM card, and then try again. Once OEM unlocking is turned on, always remember to turn it back off if you don’t need it.\nPlease note: If you can enable “OEM unlocking” on your device, it means this phone allows bootloader unlocking and you can install CalyxOS. If “OEM unlocking” is greyed out, you may have the Verizon version. Please keep in mind that unlocking bootloader is different from unlocking a carrier-locked phone.","title":"Verizon Pixels","url":"/install/verizon/"},{"page_type":"pages","content":"[[Install => install]] / Pixel 7a\nTerminology\n  Factory Image: This is a zip file that contains the entire CalyxOS operating system to be installed on your device.\n  Flashing: On Android devices, installing a new operating system is called “flashing,” because it writes a new factory image to the device’s flash memory.\n  Android Device: The device that you are installing CalyxOS on to.\n  Host Computer: The Windows computer used to send commands to the Android Device.

In that case, connect to a WiFi network and then try again.\nObtaining an unlock code\nMotorola requires you to request for a code to unlock the bootloader of these phones. For brand new devices, sometimes it may take up to 3 days before the phone will let you actually enable OEM unlocking. It can be instant or sooner than 3 days as well in many cases.\nDo note that unlocking your Motorola voids it’s warranty.\nThe CalyxOS device-flasher currently does not handle this process, and thus you’ll have to manually unlock the device after obtaining the code.\nIn the future, we’ll try to automate as much of it as possible.\nUnlock code link\nhttps://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a\nPrepare your host computer\nInstall USB drivers for Windows\nWindows requires specific USB drivers in order for device-flasher to work.\nDownload Google USB Driver\nOpen that page, click Click here to download Google USB Driver ZIP file, then accept the terms and conditions. Save the ZIP file to your host computer.\n  Put your Android device in [[fastboot]] mode.\n  Connect your Android device to your computer’s USB port.\n  On the Windows computer, extract the downloaded Google USB Driver ZIP file.\n  Right-click on the Android_winusb.inf file and hit install.

In that case, connect to a WiFi network and then try again.\nPrepare your host computer\nInstall USB drivers for Windows\nWindows requires specific USB drivers in order for device-flasher to work.\nDownload Google USB Driver\nOpen that page, click Click here to download Google USB Driver ZIP file, then accept the terms and conditions. Save the ZIP file to your host computer.\n  Put your Android device in [[fastboot]] mode.\n  Connect your Android device to your computer’s USB port.\n  On the Windows computer, extract the downloaded Google USB Driver ZIP file.\n  Right-click on the Android_winusb.inf file and hit install. Note: Install may show under “Show more options”.\nFor more information, see Android developer site.\nDownload device-flasher\nDownload device-flasher.exe\nSave this executable to a new directory, where you will also later save the CalyxOS image.\nVerify Digest\nThis is an optional step, useful for ensuring you have the correct device-flasher executable. Open a terminal on your host computer, change to the directory where you saved device-flasher, and then run:\nCertUtil -hashfile device-flasher.exe SHA256\nAnd ensure the result says bb101e204eb946fc76dd1d968606d52da50dbc0ca5464f2c339cdd0da7b705dc. This is the unique digest of the device-flasher. If it doesn’t match, then you have a corrupted or incorrect file.\nVerify Signature\nFor the highest level of confidence, you can optionally download the signature file and then [[verify it => verify]].\nDownload factory image\nDownload CalyxOS Image\nSave this image in the same directory as device-flasher. This image will only work for SHIFT6mq (axolotl). Any attempt to install this image on a different device model may brick (destroy) the Android device.\nDo not extract or rename the zip, simply copy it as-is.\nOnce downloaded, the next step is to verify the image. This step is optional, but verification helps ensure that you downloaded the image correctly, and that you got the correct image.\nVerify Digest\nTo verify the image, open a terminal window on the host computer where you saved the image and run the command:\nCertUtil -hashfile axolotl-factory-25517010.zip SHA256\nAnd ensure the result says ccea8a105419157077575fe0a0be3504e3ebba6bcb683660c786569b3c6be4de.

Ensure that both the CalyxOS image and device-flasher are in the same directory.\nRun device-flasher per the below instructions and then follow the steps shown on the computer screen.\nDouble-click device-flasher to run it.\nYour anti-virus may falsely flag device-flasher as infected. This is because the program is written in the Go programming language, see the Go FAQ for more information.\nUnlock the bootloader\nAt some point in the installation process, it will ask you to unlock the bootloader.\nNOTE: if the bootloader is already unlocked, you will not see the unlock bootloader menu and installation will proceed automatically without you needing to touch anything.\nThe bootloader unlock menu looks like this:\nPress a volume key to select UNLOCK THE BOOTLOADER option. Then press the power key to activate that option.\nSuccess?\nOnce device-flasher is finished, you should now have a fully functional CalyxOS device. If not, please see our [[community]] page for where you can post your questions.\nTroubleshooting\nError running device-flasher\nIf you get a mysterious error when running device-flasher, or if device-flasher hangs, it may be a USB problem. Try connecting to a different USB port on your computer (yes, not all USB ports are created equal) or a different USB cable.\nHow do I tell if the bootloader is locked?\nIn [[fastboot]] “Device State: locked” means the bootloader is locked.\nOn the initial boot screen, you may also see this if the bootloader is unlocked:\nThe bootloader is unlocked and software integrity cannot be guaranteed.

For new installs, factory images will be available at a later date.\nChangelog:\n  Merge Xiaomi’s March 2021 Security update\n  Update Kernel to 4.4.261\n  Include 10.0 Firmware (September 2020)\nRead before installing\nThis update contains the bootloader and additional firmware files. While we have taken utmost care to make sure this works, and done lots of testing, incorrect or interrupted installation may lead to a non-working phone.\nFor testing this build, you need to enable USB Debugging on your device, and then run:\nadb shell setprop sys.update.channel a2ten\nAnd then, Settings -> System -> Updates -> Check for updates. That will begin downloading and then install the build.\nIf that doesn’t work, you can also try running:\nadb shell cmd jobscheduler run --force app.seamlessupdate.client 1\nSo far in our testing it works well, but additional testing is always helpful and appreciated.\nIf you can wait, it will hit the beta channel later, and then the stable channel after that, you won’t have to do anything, your device will get the update automatically.\nAdditional details:\nThe way this works is that we included the bootloader (abl) from stock Oreo 8.1, and the rest from stock Q 10.0. The old bootloader is needed because that’s the only version that supports Verified Boot with a custom OS like ours, however we can safely upgrade the rest, to an extent.\nYou may have noticed the September 2020 date above, unfortunately that is due to a bug with all Xiaomi firmware after that. Updating to those from any older build results in needing a factory reset - you simply cannot upgrade without wiping data. This is not desirable, and hence for now we’ve included the last working firmware where this wasn’t required.","title":"Mi A2 10.0 Firmware","url":"/news/2021/03/29/mi-a2-ten-firmware/"},{"page_type":"posts","content":"April is amongst us, and with it comes a security update, but wait, there’s more.\nThis update contains a lot of new features and bug fixes that we’ve been hard at work over the last few months.

We’ve moved to a new model for sharing common code between Chrome and WebView (called “Trichrome”) which gives the same benefits of reduced download and install size while having fewer weird special cases and bugs.”\n  \nHowever, the system handles this shared common code (called Trichrome Library) differently from a typical app, and as such F-Droid was not able to update it.\nWe submitted changes to F-Droid to allow updating of Trichrome, which have since been merged and are included in the April builds. That means we can know ship Chromium updates via F-Droid easily.\nIt turned out that F-Droid would have needed some system privileges to actually see the details about the “Trichrome Library” installation on the device so that it could actually update it. We didn’t want to grant any extra privileges to F-Droid itself, however we already have an F-Droid Privileged Extension which is meant exactly for something like this.\nThe changes:\n  Client (the app): https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/merge_requests/967\n  Privileged Extension (the component that allows automatic installs / background updates): https://gitlab.com/fdroid/privileged-extension/-/merge_requests/58","title":"Chromium 90 available for testing","url":"/news/2021/04/13/chromium-90/"},{"page_type":"posts","content":"CalyxOS includes microG by default, and you get [[three choices => microg]].

It seemed to work in some cases, not all.\nAt the same time, we had heard that Vanced microG had this Huawei login button which seemed to work for everyone. We had already looked at that code once, so we decided to try that approach.\nAt first, we tried to spoof just the ‘brand’ reported. AOSP sets it to Android, Google sets it to Google. Didn’t work.\nNext, we thought it might be the fingerprint (which contains the build info). Both brand and fingerprint are usually spoofed on custom ROMs for Google Play compatiblity, so we thought that might be it. Tried, didn’t work.\nAfter that we decided trying to spoof all of the device details like microG does, didn’t work.\nFinally, we settled on just pulling in the full code from Vanced (something we wanted to do at first but decided to see if the other approaches worked.).\nThis is what is being shipped in the APK now.\nNote: If you take a brief look at the code, it may seem like microG is sending a lot of details about your device to Google. However, if you look closer, it spoofs a lot of that (it doesn’t even have access to things like the serial number), which means most of the data it sends to Google would match exactly with other devices, making it hard to pick you out.","title":"microG Google Account Login fix, take two","url":"/news/2021/04/16/microg-google-login/"},{"page_type":"posts","content":"With May comes another security update packed to the brim with new features.\nChangelog:\n  May Security update (2021-05-05)\n  Built-in Work profile support - create a new work profile directly from Settings without having to install any third party apps.\n  Create a work profile from Settings -> System -> Multiple users -> Add user or profile -> Work profile\n  You can select which apps to include in the profile, and also turn it on and off as you want.

CalyxOS provides timely monthly updates for all supported devices. Let’s walk through how the process works.\nTL;DR: CalyxOS integrates monthly updates ASAP. If you have a Pixel 3 or newer, you get the full security update. If you have a Pixel 2 or Mi A2, we are unable to update some proprietary components, but all of the open source parts are kept up to date.\nAOSP\nAndroid Open Source Project - the base for CalyxOS.\nGoogle usually releases the security update on the first Monday of each month, which means it was May 3rd this month. This is available in two parts, one are the new builds for all support Pixel devices (Pixel 3 and newer currently), and the other is source code updates to AOSP.\nThat is where it starts for CalyxOS - we wait for the source code to be released to AOSP, and then get started on merging the changes into CalyxOS.\nProprietary bits\nAll current devices need a good sprinkling of proprietary code to even boot and have full hardware functionality. We cannot make any changes ourselves to these files, and thus we have to rely on the manufacturer to provide updates.\nGoogle provides monthly updates for all supported devices, which currently means the Pixel 3 and newer devices.\nThe proprietary bits can be divided into two parts:\n1. Blobs\nThe various proprietary drivers needed for the device to work. This includes the parts needed to make the camera work, eSIM, graphics, amongst other things.\n2. Firmware / Bootloader\nThe other part of the proprietary components, responsible for booting the device and also controlling the various components such as the modem.\nDevice status\nCalyxOS currently supports 12 devices, and some of them have their own device-specific quirks.\nPixels 4a (5G), 5, 4a, 4 XL, 4, 3a XL, 3a, 3 XL, 3\nThese devices are still supported by Google, meaning they get timely monthly security updates, and thus we are able to include all the various security fixes in our builds. All components, both proprietary and open source are kept up to date by Google and hence we’re able provide all of that in our releases.\nPixels 2 XL, 2\nGoogle stopped updating this device late 2020, which means that it no longer gets any updates for the proprietary components.\nWhat we can update:\n  The OS code, as it common for all.\n  The kernel, since it’s open source.\nWhat we cannot update further:\n  The proprietary bits, both the blobs and firmware / bootloader are stuck on the October 2020 version.\nXiaomi Mi A2\nThe A2 being an Android One device was a big part of why we chose to support it, since it’s still getting monthly updates. However, the monthly updates aren’t always on time, usually they’re released towards the end of the month, so it lags behind a bit compared to the rest.\nWhat we can update:\n  The OS code, common for all.\n  The kernel, since it’s open source.\nDelayed updates:\n  Proprietary blobs\nWe update them as soon as the update is available, but this means that it lags behind by a month or two. i.e. The May update for the A2 is still using the proprietary blobs from March 2021 since Xiaomi’s April build was delayed / pulled due to an issue, and thus we didn’t have the updates available in time.\nComplicated situation:\n  Proprietary firmware / bootloader.\nYou might have read something about needing to install Stock Oreo 8.1 before installing CalyxOS on the Mi A2 - this was needed because newer versions wouldn’t let you relock the bootloader. We worked around this in April 2021, by including just the Oreo bootloader but newer firmware into our builds. However, the newer firmware had to be from September 2020, since due to a Xiaomi bug updating to any newer (October 2020 or March 2021, doesn’t matter) results in a factory reset. This happens with the stock OS too, if you update from September to October (or newer) it asks you to factory reset.\nThis covers the security update situation for all supported devices.

Google stopped updating the Pixel 2 series as of December 2020.\nUp till now, we extended these phones useful lifetimes by patching the open source components: AOSP and the Linux kernel. Linux kernel 4.4 was a long-term support kernel, but has stopped receiving updates this month.

This means that although we do make some changes, such as the handling of proprietary files, most of the work is already done by Google.\nWe also want to support devices for as long as possible. This reduces e-waste and makes CalyxOS more accessible to users who can’t afford to replace their phone every few years. Therefore, we try to pick recently released devices because it takes a long time to get them fully working, and because supporting devices with a full feature set and security updates beome harder, and sometimes impossible, the older they get.\nWe would like to support more affordable and widely available devices than just the Pixels, which are expensive and only sold in a select few countries.\nWe supported the Xiaomi Mi A2 because it was an Android One device, which meant that it received timely security updates from it’s release in July 2018 until manufacturer support ended in August 2021.\nPlanned devices, short term\nIn the coming months, we intend to support the following devices:\nFairphone 4\n  Fairphone graciously sent us a FP4 device to help with development. Thanks for that!\n  We have worked in cooperation with other Free and Open Source Android based projects to get this working\n  /e/ OS already had Android 11 running on this device, which helped serve as a known good working base to get LineageOS 18.1 running, in collaboration with some other developers already working on porting LineageOS.\n  Based on that, we were also able to get LineageOS 19 booting.\n  All of the above means that a lot of the work needed to get an open source non-manufacturer ROM running on the device has already been done, and we’re able to utilize that as a base and work on top of that.\n  We were able to install our build of CalyxOS 3 - Android 12 and re-lock the bootloader. It’s quite functional too, with only a few minor bugs remaining to be fixed, which we are working on.\nOnePlus 8T, 9\n  These devices are officially supported by LineageOS, thus basically all of the hard work is already done.\n  We experimented with this in late 2021 just before Android 12 was released, however we ran out of time to release a build. We were able to get CalyxOS running, and re-lock the bootloader.\n  Now that we’re done with the update to Android 12, we can revisit our OnePlus port.\n  We’ll also look into supporting the 9R, 9 Pro, and perhaps 9RT if there’s demand for those.\nOther devices\n  These are the devices we’re initially focusing on, however they won’t be the only ones we add support for this year!\n  We’ll support the new Pixels as they come out of course.\n  We also want to support other devices, especially ones that are cheaper and globally available - however we will need to make some other changes for those based on our findings, stay tuned for more updates!\nUnlikely to be supported\n  We’re often asked about supporting the following OEMs / devices. Unfortunately, we’re unlikely to to be able to for the reasons listed below.\nFairphone 3\n  It’s still on Android 10 officially, with old hardware not supported by Qualcomm any longer, and thus too old for us to support since we only support the latest Android release.\nSamsung\n  Samsung has been really good with updates lately, sometimes release them even before Google does!\n  However, as far as we know they do not support re-locking the bootloader.\n  In fact, some of their models don’t even let you unlock the bootloader in the first place.\n  Additionally, due to all of these factors, there’s not much custom ROM development for these devices in general.\n  All of this means we’re unlikely to support any Samsung devices.\nNokia\n  Nokia devices mostly run Android One and receive timely monthly security updates.\n  Sadly they don’t allow unlocking the bootloader at all on most of their phones which means you can’t install any custom ROMs on them.\nOthers\n  It’s hard to make a blanket statement for all other devices, we will look at more devices in the next few months and post about them here.\nBuilds\n  We plan to release test builds for these new devices as we can.\n  You can join our testers channel if you’d like to help test those!\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Matrix (Primary)\n      Telegram (Bridge)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      CalyxOS Testers\n      #calyxos-testers:matrix.org\n      CalyxOSTesters","title":"Future device support","url":"/news/2022/02/25/device-support/"},{"page_type":"posts","content":"We’ve seen the many reports of push notification delays, and experienced them ourselves as well.\nWe believe we’ve managed to fix the issue, and a test APK is now available.\nYou can get it from our test F-Droid repo, https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyx-fdroid-repo\nTo add it, simply add this URL to F-Droid -> Settings -> Repositories -> Plus sign at the top right: https://calyxos.gitlab.io/calyx-fdroid-repo/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=C44D58B4547DE5096138CB0B34A1CC99DAB3B4274412ED753FCCBFC11DC1B7B6\nAlternatively, you can scan the below QR code:\nThe changes included have all been sent to microG upstream for integration in the codebase so that everyone can benefit.\n  https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/pull/1681\nWe will continue observing push notification behaviour, and update things as needed.\nTechnical\nWith all the push notification fixes we’ve done previously, push notifications were indeed working fine - microG was getting the messages on time from Google.\nHowever the way Signal sets up push notifications with Google Cloud Messaging / microG is quite smart - it does not send any data at all through Google, just the fact that there is a notification.\nLiterally, AppData{key=notification, value=} is what it gets.\nOn receiving that, Signal contacts their own servers to get the encrypted notification content directly, and then decrypts it on device.\nHowever, Android is very restrictive of what apps can do in the background to improve battery life, and as such that last part wasn’t working. microG does have the code to temporarily allow the app to do what’s needed when it gets a notification, however it wasn’t working on Android 12.

However, upon closer inspection, it was found out that to get this fully working we’d have to use some leaked proprietary files - which we didn’t want.\n  We’re aware of other ROMs making Android 12 available for this device, however the above factors still stand and thus we had to drop this device.\nPixel 3, 3 XL\n  Google’s last update was in Feb 2022, Android 12\n  We’re continuing to provide Android 12L builds till February 2023.\n  Linux version 4.9 LTS is expected to end January 2023\n  We will provide Android 12 builds till then at least.

Thus it was decided that we will start to ship a fork of Bromite as our version of Chromium.\nWe also used to ship DuckDuckGo Browser as the default, but we’ve dropped that in the June update.\n  Having multiple browsers is confusing for users.\n  With a Bromite fork now, we have built in adblocking.\nWhat you need to do\nNothing!\nIf you’re already running CalyxOS, then you’ll get this directly with the June update, CalyxOS 3.6.0.\nIf you’re already using Bromite on CalyxOS - this does not affect that at all, it replaces the Chromium version we shipped.\nWe don’t plan on making these builds available for normal installation on other ROMs, you can simply install Bromite directly on those.\nFeatures\n  Built in AdBlocking, enabled by default.\n    \n      Disable globally from Chromium -> Menu (top right) -> Settings -> AdBlock settings\n      Disable per-site from Chromium -> padblock (top left) -> Permissions -> Ads\n      automatically updated adblock filters\n      customizable adblock filters via user-provided URL (see https://www.bromite.org/custom-filters)\n    \n  \n  Native Android autofill support\n  Most if not all of Bromite’s privacy-related features are included.\n  Some other features are also included, but not all of them, for now.\nDifferences\n  We try to build everything we ship in the OS ourselves, and it also gets signed with our private keys.\n  We’re starting with a smaller set of patches to keep the port manageable on our end.\n  Additionally, we build a different variant than upstream to share some code between WebView and the browser given that we’re shipping both at the same time in the OS.\n  The idea was that we can always add more later depending on how things go.\nKnown issues\n  Chromium (and other Chromium based browsers) crash on video playback if microG is disabled. Looking into it.\n  Enabling native autofill for incognito mode causes a crash, looking into it.\nFuture\nChromium version updates\nGoing forward, we will ensure that updates are timely.\nAs a first step towards this, we started on trying to port to 103 already, and opened a discussion with Bromite on how to proceed for this version and also going forward.\nWe will try and get the port done around the time the last/fourth beta is released, which is usually a week or so before the same release gets bumped up to stable.\nExample: 102.0.5005.58: Beta -> May 19 2022, Stable -> May 24 2022\nDelivering those updates to your phone\nWe’ve had patches in F-Droid to be able to update Chromium outside OS updates, and while for the most part it works, there have always been reports of some people not being able to update. We’ve tried a few fixes so far but nothing has been 100% reliable.\nTo end that once and for all, we’re testing a patch directly to the OS to allow updating this seamlessly.

Our apologies for the inconvenience.\n  Calendar (Etar): Fix crash when creating new event.\n  Double tap to sleep is temporarily broken, will be available again in the next update\n  Allow Chromium (and many other browsers) to use autofill\n  Fix work profile apps occasionally missing in recents for profiles created going forward\n  A fix for some of the existing work profiles with the same bug will be avaiable in the next update\nClock app\n  In the previous build (4.3.1/4.3.2), we merged some improvements to the AOSP Clock app, which led to it asking for the PHONE permission, and crashing when not given.\n  This also resulted in alarms being broken for those who didn’t open the app at all, or opened it and denied the permission. They worked fine for those who opened the app and gave the permission.\n  For this build (4.4.0), we have reverted the changes entirely, thus taking away the PHONE permission. This should fix alarms.\n  Going forward, we will take further care to make sure that something like this doesn’t happen again. Both the permission, and alarms being broken.\nBackground\n  The AOSP Clock app, like most other AOSP apps, doesn’t really receive any updates.\n  LineageOS does a lot of improvements to this app, and thus we’ve been shipping with those to provide a better experience.\n  The AOSP Clock app has always had the PHONE permission, however it was restricted to older Android versions.\n  A recent update bumped the targetSdk of the Clock app to the latest, Android 13 / API 33. Part of this required making the PHONE permission required again.\n  It was used to detect if a call is ongoing during an alarm, and if so, play a different, less loud tone. It wasn’t used for anything else at all. That can be reviewed in it’s removal below.\n  If the permission was denied, the app crashed, thus making it unable to play the alarm\n  Google’s proprietary Clock app somehow detects phone calls without needing this permission, however we haven’t been able to figure out how just yet.\n  Going forward, we’ve decided to simply remove the permission.\nNote\n  \n    Over-the-air Updates:\n    [[CalyxOS updates => updates]] are delivered over-the-air (OTA) automatically, without any manual intervention needed.

Then in August / September we have the new Android version.\nThese quarterly updates include a LOT of code changes. They’re also that month’s security update, meaning we have to get it all integrated quickly.\nThis led to a scenario where the first build of this month had a bunch of bugs that we couldn’t catch before the release, and we didn’t want to delay security updates either so we didn’t wait too long to test out every single thing.\nWe’re looking into ways to maintain stability while also not delaying security updates. See this GitLab issue for the existing discussion. We’ll post an update once we have something implemented.\nNavigation\nAs noted in the changelog below, 2 button navigation has been dropped.\nIt had a bug after Google’s March 2023 changes, wherein the recents menu (list of running apps) would only show on the homescreen.\nGoogle never included 2 button navigation on devices newer than Pixel 4, and given that those are all no longer supported, this feature doesn’t get tested or fixed by them.\nAs such, given we had already kept it alive for years longer than Google did, we decided to drop it, because even if we fixed it now (which may have taken a lot of time), it could’ve broken again in the future.\nWe’d much rather spend time on privacy and security related features.\nChangelog\n  CalyxOS 4.7.5\n  Drop 2-button navigation.

Testing and feedback appreciated!\nF-Droid Basic 1.17.0:\n  targetSdk set to 33 (Android 13), and a bump to 34 (Android 14) planned soon.\n  Need to confirm updates only once per app, after that they’ll install automatically in the background.\n  No extra privileges required!\nBackground\nOne of the first things we wanted to do was increase the targetSdk of the F-Droid app to the latest, and the quickest way we found of doing that was through this “basic” variant the F-Droid codebase already had, but was never released.\nIt’s the same as “full” F-Droid with 2 major omissions - Nearby / Swap feature, which lets you share apps to other devices, and the Panic trigger functionality. This was an advantage for the targetSdk work though because some of that code was (and still is) taking time to port.\nAll this work on bumping “Basic” to targetSdk33 has also already allowed a bump to targetSdk 28 for “full” F-Droid, version 1.17.\nThat meant we were able to work on parts such as support for automatically installing updates without user confirmation, and the many other under the hood changes needed to support that on modern Android versions.\nThis app works on CalyxOS and also any other Android you want to use it on - Calyx has always wanted to do things in a way that benefits the greater community.\nWe’ll continue working on the F-Droid app and try and keep doing bugfixes and feature improvements all around.\nWhy F-Droid\nWhile deciding to go ahead with this, we also considered various other options, such as:\n  Other alternative F-Droid clients, switching to one of those and improving that\n  Other app stores, same.\n  Writing our own to do what we need\nHowever, in the end we decided to stick with improving the official F-Droid client, because that way our work not only benefits CalyxOS users, but also all F-Droid users.\nF-Droid status for existing CalyxOS users\nCalyxOS currently ships with the “full” version of the F-Droid app. That is also being updated gradually, with our aim being to test out the new code via “Basic” first before it all ends being deployed in “full” to a much wider userbase.\nThe F-Droid app was previously a system app in CalyxOS (although it does not specifically directly have any extra privileges), and has become a user app since CalyxOS 4.12.2 (meaning it’d be just like any other app)\nF-Droid will just keep working the same for you as it goes through this transition.\nPanic\nCalyxOS will eventually switch to “F-Droid Basic”, meaning the panic functionality found in the “full” F-Droid won’t be available. However, we now have a replacement “Panic” app built into the OS, since CalyxOS 4.12.2. It is able to work with any apps, not just apps installed from F-Droid, leading to a better experience.\nPrivileged Extension\nCalyxOS currently includes the F-Droid Privileged Extension. Once all of the above is done, it’ll no longer be needed given that updates can be automatically installed in the background without any additional user confirmation (after the first time). As such, we will be removing it in the future.\nCalyxOS App Installer\nCalyxOS offers a list of apps to optionally install during first setup. This list is actually a local, on device F-Droid repo. Previously it used some custom code to keep things simpler, but we’re happy to say that it’s now using the F-Droid libraries.\nThe libraries make it much easier to use F-Droid’s code and functionality.\nIt is already shipping since CalyxOS 4.6.0 (February 2023)\nThe app is called Lupin, and it’s built using Jetpack Compose!\nCalyxOS App Updater\nWork in progress.\nAs a part of all of these changes, the CalyxOS team has also been working on a new simple app updater. It also uses the F-Droid libraries, which means that it’s a relatively simple application.\nIt’s also going to be a non-privileged system app, meaning it’ll be able to update apps in the background without any extra system permissions needed.\nIt’s not currently shipping yet but will be available in a future CalyxOS release.","title":"CalyxOS & F-Droid","url":"/news/2023/09/04/f-droid/"},{"page_type":"posts","content":"CalyxOS 4.13.0 - September 2023 Security update (partial) is now available for all supported devices.\n  \n    \n      Release channel\n      Date\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Beta\n      7 September, Thursday\n    \n    \n      Security express\n      8 September, Friday\n    \n    \n      Stable\n      Skipped, will go straight to 4.13.2\n    \n  \nChangelog\n  CalyxOS 4.13.0\n  September 2023 Security update (Partial)\n  Google did not release an update for the Pixels this month, like it usually does.

Some have 2. That makes working much easier. Not everyone has every other device.\n  We figured that it’d be easier to start with just one device, fix some bugs and then release it for all.\n  We didn’t want to release something too buggy / non functional.\n  At the same time, no matter how much testing we do, there’ll always be something we missed, so it’s better to release it and get some feedback.\nKnown issues\n  All hardware should work\n    5.0.0\n  \n  If you’re using secondary users + work profile a lot, suggest waiting for a future build, some fixes are missing.\n  Hide apps functionalty is missing.\nSteps\nOTA updates for existing CalyxOS users\n  Make sure your phone is running the latest CalyxOS version 4.14.0\n  Backup your data - you can use SeedVault, the included Backup app.\n  Enable USB Debugging on your phone.\n  From your computer: adb shell setprop sys.update.channel fourteen\n  Then, on your phone: Settings -> System -> System update settings -> Check for updates\nFresh installs, factory images\n  Download the factory images from the links below.\n  Please follow the installation instructions at [[install]], but use the latest factory image you just downloaded instead of the one linked on that page.\nDownloads\n  DeviceLinkSignatureSHA256\n  \n    Pixel 6a (bluejay)\n    Download\n    Signature\n    e7649a2341cefb7f90b438ba68259588f961524c05ed0919a6f34ca85fae1435\n  \nTimeline\nThe below gives an overview of how the CalyxOS team went about the Android 14 work.\nAugust\n  We planned out some of how we’d like the Android 14 port to go,\nand starting doing some work in preparation\nSeptember\n  Android 14 was originally rumored to release in September,\nbut apparently it got delayed due to a last minute issue.\n  We were waiting for it, and also used this opportunity to do\nsome more preparation work.\n  A big part of that was going through every single change we\nmade to Android 13, and re-organizing / cleaning them up\nfor easier porting. This was done at staging/android13-rebase\nWednesday, October 4\n  Google released Android 14 to AOSP, and also for the Pixels 5 and newer on this day.\n  We started working on it right away, watching the source code get uploaded, looking at the changes made, and bringing those in for CalyxOS.\nThursday, October 5\n  We ported a good chunk of our changes to Android 14.\n  A Chromium Early stable update was released, version 118. We started porting our changes to that too.\n  Also started working on updating the various included apps for Android 14.\nFriday, October 6\n  We ported the vast majority of our changes to Android 14.\n  Testing and review pending at this point.\nSaturday, October 7\n  We finished doing the code changes required for the various Pixels which got Android 14 (Pixel 5 and newer).\n  This includes things such as carrier support, tweaks to run Google Camera, and more.\nSunday, October 8\n  Test day. Make sure all hardware was functional on all supported devices.\n  Wi-Fi, bluetooth, mobile data, phone calls, camera, and so on.\nMonday, October 9\n  Started looking at the features that were pending to be ported to Android 14.\n  Tested an upgrade from Android 13 to Android 14, making sure that no data was lost.\n  SeedVault backup app testing - ensuring backup and restore works.\n  Tried porting Android 14 to Pixel 4a real quick. It didn’t boot, so we’ll try again later after releasing 14 for the other devices.\nTuesday - Thursday, October 10-12\n  Reviewing all the changes done, and finalizing them.\n  Porting our features to Android 14, fixing them.\n  Pixel 8 source code released, started looking at that.\nFriday, October 13\n  Final preparation for the first test build.\n  Tested everything left, fixed any issues that arised to finalize.\nSaturday, October 14\n  Made the first test build, started doing yet another internal full test run\n  Ran into an issue with that build. Found the fix, made another build\n  That’s what’s released as CalyxOS 5.0.0 for Pixel 6a\nRest of October\n  We’ll continue working on Android 14.

Which is why we keep trying to support more and more devices for a longer period of time.\nThese 3 motorola phones are relatively inexpensive (especially compared to the Pixels), and have much wider availability - Motorola sells phones in a lot of countries all around the world. Those 2 factors are very important to us.\nAdditionally, these devices already had some custom ROM developement going on, and we helped with the official LineageOS port of these devices, as that’s where we get our device / hardware specific code from.\nPre-install notes\nObtaining an unlock code\nMotorola requires you to request for a code to unlock the bootloader of these phones. For brand new devices, sometimes it may take up to 3 days before the phone will let you actually enable OEM unlocking. It can be instant or sooner than 3 days as well in many cases.\nDo note that unlocking your Motorola voids it’s warranty.\nThe CalyxOS device-flasher currently does not handle this process, and thus you’ll have to manually unlock the device after obtaining the code.\nIn the future, we’ll try to automate as much of it as possible.\nUnlock code link\nhttps://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a\nMoto G32\nYou can install it by following the instructions at [[devon]].\nMoto G42\nYou can install it by following the instructions at [[hawao]].\nMoto G52\nYou can install it by following the instructions at [[rhode]].\nNote\n  \n    Over-the-air Updates:\n    [[CalyxOS updates => updates]] are delivered over-the-air (OTA) automatically, without any manual intervention needed.

Some have 2. That makes working much easier. Not everyone has every other device.\n  We figured that it’d be easier to start with a few devices, fix some bugs and then release it for all.\n  Also, because of the way things are, anything that works on Pixel 6a should be fine for 6 and 6 Pro, and so on for the others too.\n  We didn’t want to release something too buggy / non functional.\n  At the same time, no matter how much testing we do, there’ll always be something we missed, so it’s better to release it and get some feedback.\nPixel 6, 6 Pro, 7, 7 Pro, 8, 8 Pro, Fold, Tablet\n  Hoping to release test builds in the coming week unless something major comes up.\nPixel 9\n  Google released these devices with Android 14, but with an entirely different codebase compared to the rest of the pixels.\n  That would’ve entailed porting all of our changes to that codebase and keeping it up to date with the rest.\n  We decided to wait for Android 15 instead, since we knew that Google would unify the codebases then, they typically do that. It was also apparent with the build IDs of the betas they released.\n  We’re hoping to release the first test builds in the coming week, unless something unexpected comes up.\nFP5, FP4, Moto G32, G42, G52, Pixel 5, 4a (5G), 5a\n  We’re still evaluating Android 15 for all of these devices.\n  Each of them will need a lot of work to get things ported and running.\n  We’ll test all hardware functionality before deciding, and post an update once we know more.\nTimeline\nThe below gives an overview of how the CalyxOS team went about the Android 15 work.\nAugust\n  This was the initial earliest expected date, based on past releases\n  We were waiting for it, and also used this opportunity to do some more preparation work.\n  A big part of that was going through every major change we made to Android 14, and re-organizing / cleaning them up for easier porting. This was done at staging/android14-rebase\nSeptember 3, 2024\n  Android 15 is released to AOSP.\n  Android 14 September Security update released for the Pixels.\n  We began working on both right away, prioritising the security update.\n  For Android 15, because only the open source components were released, we used the beta updates as a base for the Pixel components.\n  The work can be seen at staging/android15\nSeptember 5, 2024\n  Released CalyxOS 5.11.0 - September 2024 Security update for Pixel 6 - 8, 11 devices total.\n  Because the only 15 builds we could use for Pixels were the betas, which had the August Security patch level, we couldn’t release that as it’d be a downgrade, and that isn’t allowed by Android.\n  We also started work on Pixel 9 and 9 Pro XL based on the same beta release.\nSeptember 8, 2024\n  Released CalyxOS 5.11.1 - September 2024 Security update for Pixel 3 - 5, FP4, FP5, motorola & SHIFT6mq\n  That’s 16 devices!\nRest of September\n  Continued work on porting our codebase to Android 15\n  We also kept working on Android 14, new features and bugfixes for all 27 supported devices.\nOctober 7, 2024\n  October 2024 Security update sources uploaded to AOSP.\n  Nothing Pixel specific included in this.\nOctober 9, 2024\n  Working on our Android 15 port and waiting on Google’s Android 15 release.\n  Released CalyxOS 5.12.0 - Partial October 2024 Security update for Pixel 6 - 8, 11 devices total.\nOctober 11, 2024\n  Released CalyxOS 5.12.1 - October 2024 Security update for Pixel 3 - 5, Fairphone 4, 5, Motos & SHIFT6MQ\nOctober 15, 2024\n  Android 15 is released for Pixel 6 and all newer Pixels.\n  We began work integrating that right away.\n  The final release didn’t differ too much from the beta we had based our work on for the Pixels, which helped as we didn’t have to do too much work to update it.\n  We also started work on the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro Fold, since that didn’t receive the beta release we were using for all other devices.\nOctober 18, 2024\n  CalyxOS 6.0.0 was being prepared for release, when at the last moment we noticed an issue.\n  We wanted to be sure about it just in case, so we decided to move the release by a day.\n  The issue was due to the changes Google has introduced for Factory Reset Protection Hardening in Android 15. This article: Here’s how Android 15 blocks thieves from bypassing factory reset protection\n covers it well.\n  For CalyxOS, since we don’t have the proprietary Google code that handles this, it meant we couldn’t ask users to input their credentials to turn it off.\n  It is only an issue if your Pixel was already running Android 15, and you didn’t “Factory Reset” from Settings before installing CalyxOS. Regardless, we wanted to err on the side of caution.\n  We have disabled this for now since it’s not useful for us right now. Will revisit in the future.\nOctober 19, 2024\n  Noticed an issue with SMS sending, due to AOSP not updating apps.\n  We found a patch on GitHub, thanks Yet another AOSP project!\n  Included that and a fix for the FRP issue mentioned above in CalyxOS 6.0.1\n  This post - Released the first Android 15 test build :)\nRest of October\n  We’ll continue working on Android 15 and Pixel 9. Our plan is to release builds regularly.\n  We’ll post an update about other devices later, after we’re done with the modern Pixels.\n  We’ll still try to push out an Android 14 update for those.","title":"Android 15 test builds for Pixel 6a, 7a, 8a","url":"/news/2024/10/19/android-15/"},{"page_type":"posts","content":"CalyxOS 6.1.0 - Android 15 is now available for the Pixel 6 - 8a\n  Pixel 9 builds will be released this week\n  Will also release Android 14 builds with the security update for other devices this week\nCalyxOS 5.12.2\n  This is one last Android 14 build for the Pixel 6 - 8a\n  You will get an update to Android 15 after that\n  If you’re already on an existing Android 15 build, you won’t get this\nRollout\n  \n    \n      Release channel\n      Date\n      Notes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Security express\n      12 November, Tuesday\n       \n    \n    \n      Beta\n      13 November, Wednesday\n       \n    \n    \n      Stable\n      13 November, Wednesday\n       \n    \n  \nChangelog\n  CalyxOS 5.12.2\n  Chromium: 130.0.6723.86\n  Chromium: Improve migration of adblock filters from Bromite\n  Update all included apps\nCalyxOS 6.1.0\n  Android 15\nRollout\n  \n    \n      Release channel\n      Date\n      Notes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Security express\n      12 November, Tuesday\n       \n    \n    \n      Beta\n      13 November, Wednesday\n       \n    \n    \n      Stable\n      18 November, Monday\n       \n    \n  \nKnown issues\n  All hardware should work\n  The new Android 15 feature “Private Space” is currently disabled, because we wanted to be sure it works well before enabling it for everyone.

At that time, one of our test devices failed to boot, which we thought was a device-specific issue and thus we skipped that device while investigating, but released for the rest\n  However, the next day, we got reports that the update won’t install correctly for some users, so we halted the rollout, and started trying to figure out what the issue\n  Unfortunately we haven’t been able to reproduce and thus determine the exact cause yet.\n  Thus, we decided to release it to at least beta and security express.\nWhat happens\n  The update should install fine. After reboot, if things are ok, you’re good to go.\n  However, after reboot, if the device does not boot, it will continue trying to boot into this update at least 5 times.\n  After that, if it still can’t boot, it’ll switch to the pre-update state and boot into that.\n  You can continue using the device now, and see the below steps to remedy to avoid a repeat.\nTesters channel\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Matrix (Primary)\n      Telegram (Bridge)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      CalyxOS Testers\n      #calyxos-testers:matrix.org\n      CalyxOSTesters\n    \n  \nSteps to remedy\n  If you’d like to help us figure out this issue, please contact us in the testers channel:\n  Go to Settings -> System -> System updates. Tap “Release channel”, and select “Stable”\n  Since this troublesome update hasn’t been released to “Stable”, your device won’t try to download the update again.\n  If it’s already downloading, you can either let it reboot, or just skip the reboot.\nChangelog\n  CalyxOS 6.2.1\n  Android 15, December 2024 Quarterly Platform Release Security update (2024-12-05), Full\n  microG: Fix some google apps not working after recent updates\n  Keyboard: Fix landscape mode\n  Chromium: 131.0.6778.135\n  Update all included apps\nNote\n  \n    Over-the-air Updates:\n    [[CalyxOS updates => updates]] are delivered over-the-air (OTA) automatically, without any manual intervention needed.

Cleartext transmission allows data to travel in network or communication channels without encrpytion or other protection layers.\nIt can occur in various types of communications, such as visiting a website, sending an email, or sharing a file.\nCleartext transmission sends data in plain, human-readable format, making it easier for unauthorized parties to read sensitive information, such as password, personal data, or private messages.\nTherefore, we bulit this feature on AOSP’s existing functionality in 2021 to improve overall device data security.\nHowever, upon review, we have discovered that this feature bears significant limitations and usability concerns.\nWhat we learned // Why we made this decision\nAfter investigating issues #1948 and #2521,\n our finding shows that AOSP’s cleartext restriction is not a comprehensive security mechanism.\nIt only inspects initial packets of a connection; once Transport Layer Security (TLS) is detected, the connection will beis marked secure, and there will be no further inspection.\nAn app could begin sending cleartext after the initial handshake without detection.\nAOSP explicitly states that this feature is meant to prevent accidental cleartext traffic, not deliberate bypasses.\nIn addition to AOSP’s functional limitations, this feature created usability problems by conflicting with other features and services, such as:\n  Blocking DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol: Private DNS setups using Cloudflare or Google failed silently.\n  Breaking QUIC traffic: Many modern apps rely on QUIC protocol to transmit data. Despite the fact that QUIC traffic was encrypted by default, it was blocked.\n  Interfering with VPNs: Some VPN traffic got misclassified as cleartext and blocked, affecting connectivity.\nGiven these problems, continuing to maintain a “best-effort” solution, one that users might mistakenly assume is fully secure,\n risks giving a false sense of protection while breaking access to other secure services and connection protocols.\nWhat’s next\nWe have already started transitioning users away from this feature:\n  In the February CalyxOS Feature update, users who had this feature enabled received a one-time notification on their device alerting them that the feature would be removed in a future update.\n  In the April CalyxOS Feature update, users who still have this feature enabled will again receive a notification (linking here) informing them that it has been removed.\nInstead of relying on this inadequate feature, you can use a VPN to protect your device’s connection and data transmission.\nAdditionally, we will continue to improve our communications about CalyxOS’ security and privacy features to ensure our users can make informed decisions and are aware of the best options for keeping their device secure and private.\nRelated GitLab issues\n  #1948\n  #2521","title":"Why we are phasing out the Cleartext Restriction feature","url":"/news/2025/05/06/cleartext-restriction/"},{"page_type":"posts","content":"CalyxOS 6.7.20 - Android 15 is now available for Pixel 6 - 9 devices\n  May security update (2025-05-05)\n  IMPORTANT: Certain Pixel devices won’t be able to downgrade after this update\nKEY Google Pixel updates\n  Google’s May 2025 Pixel update for Pixel 6 (6, 6 Pro, 6a) and Pixel 8 (8, 8 Pro, 8a) devices incremented the anti-roll back version for the bootloader.\n  This prevents the above devices from rolling back to previous vulnerable versions of the bootloader.\n  Once you flash the May 2025 update on these devices, you won’t be able to flash and boot older Android 15 builds.\n  That update affects CalyxOS, Stock Android OS, and all other Android distributions.\n  Trying to downgrade after this update may fail and make your phone unbootable.\nRollout\n  \n    \n      Release channel\n      Date\n      Notes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Security express\n      7 May, Wednesday\n       \n    \n    \n      Beta\n      8 May, Thursday\n       \n    \n    \n      Stable\n      12 May, Monday\n       \n    \n  \nChangelog\n  CalyxOS 6.7.20\n  May 2025 Security update (2025-05-05)\n  Chromium: 136.0.7103.60\n  Update all included apps\nNote\n  \n    Over-the-air Updates:\n    [[CalyxOS updates => updates]] are delivered over-the-air (OTA) automatically, without any manual intervention needed.
