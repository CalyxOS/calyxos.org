I\u0027ll leave it at this: it seems like there\u0027s an aesthetic distaste for this change that is outweighing everything else, even though many other guides have warnings like this in similar places so that they stand out. Like I said, a warning like this would have helped me, and I think that matters.\n\nFixed scripts will help for the new uploads, but we\u0027re still gambling with a small handful of users who may not be using the latest factory images for whatever reason. We\u0027re just saying \"too bad\" because we refuse to add a modest warning.\n\nWeb Flasher will hopefully solve everything, but we\u0027ve been saying that for years.",

This installation page is meant for people using device-flasher, for which this warning isn\u0027t valid.\n\nThe vast majority of readers of this page care about installing using the official install method, and as such, I didn\u0027t want to add such scary warnings which don\u0027t affect them.\n\nOld factory images already won\u0027t work for the fairphones due to anti rollback - we only link the latest, and if somebody tries to grab the old and flash that, regardless of this warning - and tries to relock, it may lead to a brick. We added some checks to that for the flasher for FP4 (get_unlock_ability), and if we find anything for FP5 we\u0027ll do that too.\n\nIt matters that it would have helped you, sure, but that doesn\u0027t mean we change the install page shown to every single user. It does mean we try and make other changes which might help though, which we are working on.\n\nWeb Flasher won\u0027t exactly help with this.",
