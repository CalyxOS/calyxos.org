Remote Key Provisioning is a sub-feature which ensures that claims made by compromised OS versions are considered invalid, and also that devices are able to recover their genuine status when newer, uncompromised OS versions are installed. This feature depends on Google servers and is primarily useful in combination with microG and services like SafetyNet, Identity Credential, and Digital Car Key. However, recent research has highlighted that Android still performs communication with Google as part of the Remote Key Provisioning system, even in the absence of microG or Google Play services. CalyxOS is currently looking into this issue and considering ways to address it.`",
