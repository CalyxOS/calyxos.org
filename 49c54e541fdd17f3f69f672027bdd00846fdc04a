We have some of it addressed in the new install guide but not all.",

In my mind, the FAQ is kind of a horrible unorganized catch all for the stuff that doesn\u0027t fit anywhere.\n\nBut for most of the content in this commit there are good logical places already where it could go, such as the about CalyxOS page, or the device compatibility page, or the security page.
