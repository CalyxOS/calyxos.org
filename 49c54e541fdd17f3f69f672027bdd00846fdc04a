We have some of it addressed in the new install guide but not all.",

In my mind, the FAQ is kind of a horrible unorganized catch all for the stuff that doesn\u0027t fit anywhere.\n\nBut for most of the content in this commit there are good logical places already where it could go, such as the about CalyxOS page, or the device compatibility page, or the security page.

Is this still worth another pass for possible redistribution of pieces to other parts of the site?\n\nThe section on anonymity did stand out to me as useful. I worry we don\u0027t emphasize the risk of \"privacy-invasive apps\" enough, especially when it comes to anonymity; it is impossible by design to prevent being uniquely fingerprinted by any untrusted Android app.",

It\u0027s more work to split them up like  this, but we can start by just splitting things found useful right away (like this Anonymity section you mentioned), and merge it right away.\n\nThere\u0027s another big chain of changes for the FAQ as well by yours truly.",
