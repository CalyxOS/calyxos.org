I especially like how you added in the discussion of how Calyx is making things more modular and self-contained, like the App Installer, App Updater, and Panic features as standalone apps.  It is a great example of something F-Droid hasn\u0027t really communicated as much as I\u0027d like to see, which is that F-Droid is an app store as well as a whole app distribution ecosystem, that can be used flexibly to suit varying needs.",
