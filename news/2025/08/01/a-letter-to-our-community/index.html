<p><a href="/news/2025/09/30/how-to-reach-the-calyxos-team/">An update on how to reach the CalyxOS team</a></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Update: August 27 2025</strong></p>

<p>We are concerned that some users may have not seen the important message in this letter about CalyxOS’ current hiatus. Therefore, we are rolling out one last OTA update to devices currently running CalyxOS to reach as many active users as we can. You can read <a href="/news/2025/08/27/last-ota-update-before-new-calyxos-release/">our post</a> for more details about this update.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Update: August 5 2025</strong></p>

<p>We appreciate your valid concerns and questions around the security and safety of CalyxOS.</p>

<p>First, we want to assure you that we have no reason to believe the security of CalyxOS and its signing keys have been compromised.</p>

<p>As you know, we announced a recent leadership transition. When senior personnel have access to signing keys and leave a team, it is security best practice to update signing keys and conduct audits. So in accordance with that, we are using this transition period to update our security protocols, including updating the signing keys and taking other steps to further protect our users.</p>

<p>In the past, security audits have been conducted for parts of CalyxOS, such as the <a href="https://seedvault.app/2021-security-quickscan-ros.pdf">Seedvault project</a>, but not for the entire project. As more and more people across the globe started using this tool, we intend to conduct a broader security audit and publish the reports for the public to review.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our community letter below, we estimate that this audit and the implementation of new security protocols and signing keys will take four to six months, but we will endeavor to complete this process as soon as possible. However, for the time being, current CalyxOS users will not be able to receive further security software updates until our new security protocols are in place.</p>

<p>Without security updates, we can only be honest that this does not guarantee the level of security we strive for, especially when global threats to privacy and human rights are at a critical moment. That is why in the meantime we have posted the recommendation that people who are running CalyxOS should uninstall the OS and follow our <a href="/community/">community channels</a> for updates, including when the latest version of CalyxOS becomes available again.</p>

<p>In case you wish to migrate to another custom ROM in the meantime, we’ve now published updated guides on how to back up and restore your device using <a href="/docs/guide/apps/seedvault/">Seedvault</a> and how to <a href="/install/stock/">restore your device to stock</a>.</p>

<p>We also understand that many community members have expressed interest in having an installation option/images for CalyxOS available again. Due to the overwhelming feedback from our community, we’ve decided to <a href="/get/factory">make the images publicly available</a> once more. <strong>Please be aware that this decision is not a recommendation to migrate to CalyxOS now.</strong></p>

<p>Please note that, just as current users will not receive further software updates without reinstalling CalyxOS when future updates are released, any device installing CalyxOS in the near future will also need to reinstall it. We want to ensure that all users are well informed before deciding to install CalyxOS at this time.</p>

<p>Again, we are very sorry for this development and we thank you for giving us—the project and more importantly the team—tremendous trust and support. We are doing our very best on our end, and are committed to keeping CalyxOS secure and this decision is a result of that commitment.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dear CalyxOS community members,</p>

<p>The last few months have been especially challenging for us as we have experienced some changes within our teams and in the Android free and open-source (FOSS) development community.</p>

<p>Nicholas Merrill, president and founder of Calyx Institute, has left the organization to pursue other projects.</p>

<p>Nick has championed privacy and data security over the last 25 years, and we thank Nick for his decades-long leadership, guidance, and contributions.</p>

<p>Chirayu Desai, the CalyxOS Tech Lead, has addressed his departure from the CalyxOS project and the organization in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CalyxOS/comments/1lxgnp8/a_personal_note/">a personal note to the public</a>.</p>

<p>We also want to express gratitude to Chirayu for his enthusiasm and incredibly hard work on CalyxOS.</p>

<p>Nick and Chirayu have been a part of the CalyxOS project and its global community for many years. Without a doubt, there is a gap to fill following their departure. 
Following their departure, there will be a period of transition as we move forward. During that time, Calyx Institute’s Interim Executive Director, Ellen McDermott, will continue to lead the organization’s important work while the CalyxOS team will focus on bridging the gap and recentering our efforts.</p>

<p>Our commitment to <a href="https://calyxinstitute.org/about">our mission</a> has not changed: defending digital privacy, advancing connectivity, and striving for a future where everyone has access to the resources and tools they need to remain securely connected. CalyxOS is an integral part of our work and stands at the center of the FOSS digital ecosystem we aspire to create. It is our responsibility to protect the privacy of current and future users of our technologies.</p>

<p>To ensure operational consistency during this transition and adhere to security best practices, our team is working to improve transparency and security through better design, communications, and infrastructure. Our ongoing priorities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upgrading the tech infrastructure supporting CalyxOS development</li>
  <li>Stabilizing update release cycles for our 25+ supported devices</li>
  <li>Revising and updating our usage and development documentation, wiki, and user guides</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>To fulfill our <a href="https://calyxos.org/community/pledge/">community pledge</a> and foster collaboration, information sharing, and inclusivity, we are engaging with our peers, partners, and security experts to ensure the delivery and integrity of all changes made during this process. After conducting a thorough inspection of the work required for successful completion of the above priorities, we have determined that it may take up to four to six months for us to provide the level of security maintenance we aim to deliver.</p>

<p>We will be switching to new signing keys along with the overhaul of the signing and verification process. As a result, current CalyxOS users will not be able to receive further security software updates until this process is in place.</p>

<p>Given the potential risk posed by the pause of maintenance and development, it’s logical that we stop providing options to install CalyxOS for now. This was an incredibly hard decision to make, and we understand that this decision may cause significant difficulties for our users.
For those wishing to remain on CalyxOS until our next release, note that you will not have the latest security patches on your device as released from the Android Open Source Project and from any proprietary sources provided by device manufacturers. We sincerely apologize for the hassle brought to you by this change, and we understand if you need to uninstall CalyxOS and migrate to another privacy-protecting Android distribution in the meantime. If you wish to continue using CalyxOS in the future, please follow our updates to reinstall CalyxOS when it becomes available again.</p>

<p>We are committed to supporting you through this process. To assist any migration, we will publish, by August 6, instructions to back up and restore your phone to a stock or custom Android distribution with Seedvault.</p>

<p>Starting with this announcement, we will be reporting our progress regularly through our <a href="https://calyxos.org/community/">community channels</a>, and we welcome your insights if you would like to contribute to this effort.</p>

<p>We thank you for your continued trust and look forward to further collaborations with people who have, are, and will be using and contributing to CalyxOS and various FOSS projects.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br />
The Calyx team</p>
