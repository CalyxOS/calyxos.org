      "message": "I just noticed that the author was changed to me, with you being added as a co-author in the commit message - was that something you did manually? I think that might explain Gerrit\u0027s wonkiness. If so, please don\u0027t worry about changing authorship in the future, unless it\u0027s something you feel strongly about. I know I reworded + added some things, but all the hardest work was yours. Thanks again!",
